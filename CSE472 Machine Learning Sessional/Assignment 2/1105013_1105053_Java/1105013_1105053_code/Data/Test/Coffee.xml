Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot;&gt;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastActivityDate="2015-01-27T21:35:46.843" CommentCount="0" />

Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Beans:&lt;/strong&gt; Robusta vs Arabica&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt;: Temperature and Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing [Extraction]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&quot;&gt;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="38" LastEditorUserId="38" LastEditDate="2015-01-27T22:37:40.693" LastActivityDate="2015-01-27T22:37:40.693" CommentCount="0" />

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to know even more?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swiss Water process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourced from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5w3t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I don&amp;#39;t know?!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="132" LastActivityDate="2015-01-28T13:34:08.870" CommentCount="0" />

This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. &lt;em&gt;It is said to help improve&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;crema&lt;/strong&gt;. &#xA;One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent.

For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp.

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat). This energy can be in the immediate environment, a result of other chemical reactions, or already present in the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to a high-rep legit subreddit AskScience user,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Unlike all of the other posters in this thread, I have done this experiment.

If you&#xA;  were to look at a single tiny bubble in a cup of foamed milk, you'd&#xA;  see that the hydrophobic ends of the milk proteins are all pointed&#xA;  inwards, towards the water-free interior of the bubble, while the&#xA;  hydrophilic ends stay put in the aqueous environment the bubbles are&#xA;  suspended in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This structure helps keep the air bubbles intact for a long time after the steaming &gt; process, all the way into your cup (and into your happy, soon-to-be caffeinated mouth).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a wonderful article on the topic see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/12/milk-foam-what-is-microfoam-why-does-milk-foam-what-is-a-cappuccino-coffee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/12/milk-foam-what-is-microfoam-why-does-milk-foam-what-is-a-cappuccino-coffee.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="141" LastActivityDate="2015-01-28T16:18:45.293" CommentCount="0" />

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xA;  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean.

This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up the Aeropress for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;inverted brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water.

Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My results vary significantly. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher.

If you're not gonna do the pre-weigh style, then the doser-timer is really great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wooden pourover stand -- custom make it yourself :) It's great for feature photography by the journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garden spray -- so you can rinse your pitchers and dump into a waste container. Unless you can install a water pump and tap water&#xA;reservoir? Pretty hassle if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might want to use an induction cooker for your swan-neck kettle. BUT, if you use an electric kettle instead, and transfer it&#xA;to your pourover kettle, you only lose a couple of Farenheits, which&#xA;is not so bad for bright filter coffees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can plug-in a frige, great. Otherwise, a cooler and camping ice packs would do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's my last suggestion, because even if you're just a kiosk, there's a ton of stuff that needs to be inside your booth.....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Small rolling table you can place beside your point-of-sale, where customers can rest their stuff while ordering from you.

I'm a barista and head of customer education at Handground. We are working on a French Press brew guide right now but since it's not done, I'll share a quick tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal with brewing coffee on any device is to maximize the extraction of good-tasting flavors and minimize the bitter ones. I suggest starting with the following recipe and then adjusting it to find the right balance of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat water to 205F&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your kettle, this might mean taking your water off the heat for about one minute after boil. Use a thermometer if possible!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weigh out coffee to 57g&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's an easy ratio to follow when deciding how much coffee to use. It's called the water-to-coffee ratio, and it will help you methodically experiment with different brew recipes. To find the water-to-coffee ratio, take the total mL of water (around 800-850mL for a normal-sized French Press) and then divide by the number of grams of coffee (mL and grams are conveniently equal in weight). In this case, 800/57 is about 14. That means our ratio is 14:1. From now on you can use the inverse of this ratio to adjust your recipe. For example, if you want to try a 15:1 ratio (a weaker coffee), take 800ml and divide by 15 to find the amount of coffee to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a scale, 57g is roughly a half cup of coffee, but remember that lighter roasts are more dense than dark roasts, so it will require less volume of coffee to reach your desired weight. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind your coffee course&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what your grind should look like: &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Handground french press grind&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's really important to have a consistent grind. If you don't the different-sized grounds will extract at different rates, meaning some of them will turn bitter and others will stay weak. This is a bad mix of flavors. For the most consistent grind, use a burr &lt;a href=&quot;http://handground.com/handground&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;coffee grinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pour water over coffee and let bloom&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dump the grounds into the French Press and then pour just enough water over the grounds so they are all saturated. If you have a scale, shoot for about as much water as you have grounds, so 57mL. The coffee will begin to bubble up and &quot;bloom&quot; if it is fresh. Let this happen for about 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pour 800mL water total, set for 4 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour 800mL of hot water into the French Press to achieve our desired water-to-coffee ratio. For most a normal 32-ounce French Press, this is about an 1 1/2 inches from the top. Start timer for 4 minutes and let the coffee steep. Place the lid on top of the grounds to capture the heat but DO NOT PLUNGE YET!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plunge after 4 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Press the plunger down through the coffee. This action will tell you something important about your coffee. If pressing the plunger is really difficult, the grind might have been too fine. There should be slight resistance but nothing that makes you struggle. This is one indication that you might need to adjust the grind, but tasting the coffee will be the ultimate test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove all coffee from French Press&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the coffee (the drink, not the grounds) in the French Press will allow for the coffee to continue extracting, turning it bitter. If you don't drink it all at once, remove it and place in a thermos or carafe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjusting your brew recipe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This recipe is just a starting point. Now you should adjust your recipe to improve the coffee. The best cups of coffee have extracted all the sweet, desirable flavors from the cup and none of the bitter, negative flavors. Naturally then, the best cup of coffee sits right at the tipping point of sweet and bitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should adjust your recipe by changing just one thing at a time. Here's a simple formula to follow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assess your latest cup of coffee&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was your coffee strong and sweet? Weak and bitter? Somewhere in the middle? Understanding this will be the starting point for adjusting your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust for coffee strength&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You adjust the strength of your coffee by changing the amount of coffee you use. We can use the water-to-coffee ratio that we talked about to do this. If your coffee is weak, or watery and tea-like, use a lower water-to-coffee ratio like 13:1 or 12:1. If your coffee is overwhelmingly strong, raise the ratio to 15:1 or 16:1. Divide the amount of water used (800ml) by desired ratio number (14, 15, 16, etc.) to find the number of grams of coffee to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew another batch of coffee with the adjusted water-to-coffee ratio and repeat until you're happy with the strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust for sweetness/extraction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength and extraction are not the same thing. Strength is the amount of coffee dissolved in the coffee solution while extraction is the percentage of ground coffee that was dissolved. Extraction controls how sweet or bitter a coffee is, but not its strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you notice your coffee is bitter, you should reduce the extraction rate. You can do this in two ways: Make the grind more course or shorten the brew time. Both will allow for less extraction, meaning less negative flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your coffee is sweet, I suggest finding its peak sweetness before being satisfied. Increase the extraction rate by using a finer grind or extending the brew time. Do this until you brew a batch of coffee that comes out bitter, and then dial your extraction rate back to the last degree where it was sweet. This is as delicious as you will be able to brew your coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize what I just wrote, here are a few key things to remember about brewing with the French Press and dialing in the optimal recipe:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistent grind is key&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your coffee is weak, increase the strength by adding more coffee. If it is too strong, use less coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your coffee is still sweet and not bitter, increase the extraction by using a finer grind or longer brew time. Do this until you find the tipping point between bitter and sweet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your coffee is bitter, dial back the extraction. Again, try to find the tipping point. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the different variables that change your coffee will become second nature the more you do it. Start sharpening your coffee skills by being methodical with the way you experiment. Adjust only one variable at a time so you can see a clear cause and effect. Most importantly, don't let the pursuit of the perfect cup spoil the fun. Any cup of coffee is better than no cup at all, so enjoy the journey. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1786" LastActivityDate="2016-05-14T20:05:29.820" CommentCount="0" />

This is due to variation in the chemical species affected by temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is like ice cream. Ice cream is least sweet when it's stone cold, and tart and heavy when it has melted. Similarly, coffee is sweetest (and best) while it's hot, and is bitter or acrid when it has cooled. Furthermore, the cooler temp has led to chemical degradation and thus the awful taste. However, you won't perceive its flavors when the coffee is too hot -- so let it cool a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your question whether the on-contact brew temperature affects end-result sweetness-sourness: there are a lot of baristas and coffee R&amp;amp;D pros who do temperature-control brewing, especially for espresso, in order to modify the flavor of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that varying temperature affects coffee flavor in a gradient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For cold brew (in case you're also curious about that), the cold temperature is a different environment entirely.

You can also use it for grinding spices or seeds. If you already have one, you will get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; odor holdover from one grinding mission to the next, but it's probably fine if you're not very picky. 10-15 quid new, or even cheaper used from a thrift shop etc. You can even mash them up with mortar and pestle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some brewing mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. The cheapest and simplest are probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drip brew&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., pour-over or auto-drip), but I online a few more down below.

You can find a really cheap auto-drip machine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001NXC5YC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;for instance this one from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, for like 10-15 quid, or even cheaper used. Water goes in the reservoir, paper filter in the basket, add some ground coffee, press the button.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's one solution for decent cup of coffee for as little as 15 quid all in (grinder, coffee cone, paper filters), or perhaps 25-30 for an auto-drip solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also questions tagged as &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/pour-over&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pour-over&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pour-over&lt;/a&gt; for how-to information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other inexpensive, though somewhat more fussy, preparations include...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;French press&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/french-press&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;french-press&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;french-press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;stove-top &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;percolator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;moka pot&lt;/a&gt;, see also my description of &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/418/whats-the-difference-between-a-percolator-and-a-moka-pot&quot;&gt;the difference between them&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/moka&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;moka&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;moka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cold brew; see &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/cold-brew&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-brew&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2016-06-02T17:55:41.340" CommentCount="0" />
