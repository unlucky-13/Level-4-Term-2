Every strong player has a repertoire of opening lines that he likes to play and in which he knows pretty well which moves are the best. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some players analyse the opening exhaustively and try to find tricky lines before they sit down to play.

Endgame theory is the most important part of chess theory. If you don't know any endgame theory then most of your games will be a matter of luck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you know how to mate with king and queen against king? Yes? Then you know some theory. King and rook versus king? King and two bishops versus king?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How about pawn endings? Do you know when king + pawn versus king is a win and when it is a draw? How about king + rook + pawn versus king + rook?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Already we have touched on a lot of important theory. If you know this theory then when you are playing the middlegame you know what kinds of endgame you can aim for and win. If you don't know how to mate with king, knight and bishop against king then don't aim for this endgame because it is going to be a draw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have an extra pawn in an endgame with just kings and several pawns and your opponent lets you swap off into an endgame where you have a king and a rook's pawn against his king and so it ends in a draw is that somehow unfair? Is this &quot;somebody who didn't really use their head to play the game?&quot; No, your opponent earned the draw by virtue of his superior theoretical knowledge. If you had the same knowledge you wouldn't let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Endgame theory is rather concrete. Middlegame theory is much more fluid. When does sacrificing the exchange give you a winning advantage? When are doubled and / or isolated pawns good? When are bishops better than knights? How about knights better than bishops? When is it OK to leave the king in the center? When is it better to castle? Again somebody who has a better understanding of these theoretical ideas will play better than somebody who doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As regards opening theory, if you don't know any opening theory you will struggle to get out of the opening against a good player. Opening theory isn't just knowing a set pattern of moves to safely develop your pieces it is also about knowing some of the typical plans that come out of the opening. It is all very well playing the first 10 or 15 moves according to &quot;the book&quot; but if you don't have some good ideas what to do next you will struggle to reach move 30 unless your opponent is in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4418" LastActivityDate="2016-04-16T20:59:30.187" CommentCount="1" />

In playing the French, Black makes a fundamental trade-off of giving White space in exchange for defensive solidity; however, Black needs to counterattack otherwise White will steamroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main feature of White in the Advance is the pawn chain c3, d4, e5.  That chain gives White space and freedom of movement.  Black's main strategy is to attack the chain and if Black can undermine White' structure, White's position will be fragile.  It is definitely not for use in every game, but it can be really handy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most essential counterattacking pawn move is ...c5, attacking the pawn chain at d4.  This will also give Black some space to develop other pieces.  ...f6 should happen a bit later, and lets Black attack the chain at two points (d4 and e5).  If White takes, it leaves Black with a structural weakness in the pawn at e6, but Black eliminates a lot of White's early advantage while gaining more piece activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the ...f6 break has to be timed right and the c8 bishop still needs to be at c8 or d7 to protect the e6 pawn (b/c that bishop usually doesn't do so much in the opening anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2569" LastActivityDate="2016-04-16T21:39:07.610" CommentCount="0" />

In the French, one basic line of thought is the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let White occupy the center&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Destroy White's center&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Occupy the center yourself&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Win the game, as White now will be totally helpless!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If black manages to complete steps 1-3 outlined above, without significant material losses or a serious weakening of the king's position, step 4 will indeed often be possible to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us examine the move f6 in view of the steps above. If White has a pawn on e5 and black plays ...f6, it's possible to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a) take on f6&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;b) defend the e5 pawn&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;c) ignore it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) If Black hasn't castled, it most likely means that Black will have to respond to this with ...gxf6. Black now typically has pawns on e6 and on f6. It is not hard to see that Black can have plans to push ...e5 in the near future, and if the pawn capture on f6 hasn't left Black's king open to direct attack, it's possible that Black will achieve steps 2-3 outlined above shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Black has castled, on the other hand, more options than ...gxf6 will be available. Often either a knight, bishop or a rook could also take on f6 in this case. In case of rook capture, Black has a semi-open f-file for his/her rook. Taking with a bishop adds more pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal. Taking with a knight adds possibilities to play ...e5 to free the black bishop on c8 in some cases. It is clear that the ...f6 break by Black has given many possibilities for future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more note: If White takes the pawn on f6, the h2-b8 diagonal will be ripe for the black bishop to occupy, often coupled with a queen on c7. This is sometimes very unpleasant for White.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) If White protects the pawn, Black has some other options with ...f6 played. If White has played f4, Black could sometimes take on e5, and if White recaptures with the f-pawn, it can in some cases be possible to play ...Qh4+ for some concrete tactical purpose. Other times Black can be perfectly happy with just trying to take over the f-file and pressure White's position that way. If White recaptures with the d4 pawn instead of the f-pawn, Black has the option to open the diagonal a7-g1 with ...c4, or play ...d4 and just try to break once again in the center, to activate his/her pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If White has played f4, and it's not good for Black to take on e5, Black can wait, and try to maneouver the c8 bishop to g6 via Bc8-d7-e8-g6. This is a standard plan in the French defense to activate that light squared bishop. Or Black can lock the center with ...f5 in some cases, to stop White from attacking the black king. In rare cases, after White has played f4, Black can even try to play ...g5, to again just try to break up White's center. This can be very risky, so it's not often the first idea Black thinks of, but it should never be forgotten, as it can recieve a great pay-off if well executed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If White guards the e5 pawn with Bf4, the g5 break is more natural, and Black can even try to go for a kingside pawn storm in some cases. Again, it has to be well executed, as it can easily expose Black's king. Otherwise it's more typical for black to keep the tension in the center, and let White make the big decision to alter the status quo. However, at every move, White has to be wary of possible alterations of the center. The same is usually true if White defends e5 with another piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;c) This option is very rare, and can only be considered if White manages to create an enormous treat elsewhere on the board that black needs to deal with immediately. If this is the case, the ...f6 break may be a bad idea. Otherwise, if White ignores the ...f6 break, Black can usually just take on e5, and normally having a knight on c6 and a queen on c7 (and maybe even a knight on d7 in some cases), this can mean that black simply wins a pawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This reply got much longer than I originally had intended it to be, but I feel like most of the reasons why Black may consider playing ...f6 in the French defense are in here. Remember that I have not included any concrete examples here, and that it all depends on the position. If ...f6 is an obvious blunder, for some reason I failed to mention here, it should of course not be played.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: ...f6 is about challenging White's control over the center, and trying to open up the position for Black's pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8300" LastActivityDate="2016-04-17T00:15:08.330" CommentCount="0" />

But you have more works to do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(respond to your comment) 3...e4 must be a bug because your engine just gave up a pawn for nothing in the next move.

You will need to check your PST table and make sure your PST evaluation beats the temptation of moving the queen out. A common mistake in early chess engines is that they put too much weight into the number of squares that the queen can control in the opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please check your PST again why your engine would prefer moving 1.e3. You must instruct the engine to move into the centre.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't use the default position for testing. It's still too early for your engine to handle it.

To quote from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In chess, the word &quot;piece&quot; has three meanings, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;It may mean any of the physical pieces of the set, including the pawns. When used this way, &quot;piece&quot; is synonymous with &quot;chessman&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (Hooper &amp;amp; Whyld 1992:307) or simply &quot;man&quot; (Hooper &amp;amp; Whyld 1987:200).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2) In play, the term is usually used to exclude pawns, referring only to a queen, rook, bishop, knight, or king. In this context, the pieces can be broken down into three groups: major pieces (queen and rook), minor pieces (bishop and knight), and the king (Brace 1977:220).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;3) In phrases such as &quot;winning a piece&quot;, &quot;losing a piece&quot; or &quot;sacrificing a piece&quot;, it refers only to a bishop or knight. The queen, rook, and pawn are specified by name in these cases, for example, &quot;winning a queen&quot;, &quot;losing a rook&quot;, or &quot;sacrificing a pawn&quot; (Just &amp;amp; Burg 2003:5)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, emphasis is mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the same article, the term pieces to include pawns has been noted since the late 1980's. Speculating, it may be that commentators did not see the need to distinguish between the terms pieces and men, hence coming into common use. For example, Josh Waitzkin's tutorials in Chessmaster, first made in the 1990's, use the term pieces instead of men. I've seen terminology become more lax over time, e.g. pieces being 'killed' instead of 'captured'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for other languages, I am unable to say I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1108" LastEditorUserId="1108" LastEditDate="2016-04-18T10:13:04.000" LastActivityDate="2016-04-18T10:13:04.000" CommentCount="2" />

Maybe you can even find an opening that lends itself to your 'style' of play. But what value does any of this have? Really?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to become a master you must be able to play all sorts of positions well. Playing a limited set of openings directly contradicts the goal of practicing a wide variety of positions. Or does it? Really? You see, we're not masters yet, so our games are likely to be unpredictable and messy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that until your middlegame and endgame skill is at the master level your opening choices matter very little. Think of it the other way; if you're playing a master and you've somehow managed an opening advantage the master will just dig in and outplay you in the middlegame or endgame. To become a master, you will also need to acquire these skills - so you'd better find ways to get opening-&lt;em&gt;dis&lt;/em&gt;advantages as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guest the real point is that even heavily unbalanced positions often have excellent drawing chances for the disadvantaged player. A master will be able to make use of these to greatly reduce the chances of a loss. The difference in opening choices in this sense comes down to the master's goals for a particular game. Would they be happy with a draw? How much do they want to risk pushing for a win if complications might also favour their opponent? Perhaps they check a database and find that their opponent only wins 2% of games that feature a Queen-side attack when the dark-square Bishop is exchanged - interesting, maybe it's worth trying a Trompovsky as White and pushing c4 early?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This line of reasoning is just beyond being useful for non-master players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now we see what Kasparov means when he says that all openings are playable. In almost all cases openings are simply &lt;em&gt;irrelevant&lt;/em&gt;.

The theme is the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;pawn break&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pawn breaks are most often done with the c or f pawns because the central d and e pawns are the most likely to become locked after an advance. There are three common motives:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undermining a pawn chain.&lt;/strong&gt; It is preferable to attack the base of a pawn chain which is why Black so often plays c5 in the advanced French. There is no inherent problem with attacking the head of a pawn chain to achieve a similar result.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening lines.&lt;/strong&gt; This will usually offer an advantage to the player with better development.

This is especially important in endgames, and you can see some examples in the same wiki article you are referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that the final square doesn't have to be the same as the starting one (e.g. Re1-e2-e3 instead of Re1-e3), although it often is (mainly in Kings' triangulation). Knight cannot do any of that, as mentioned in answer by @magd. Knight can just jump from and back to the same square, but the opponent can e.g. also do some repetitive move and you end up right where you started. Knight just cannot take the route to its' destination which will lose exactly one tempo (or any other odd number).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But all other pieces (even pawns if they are at their starting square) can take an extra move while going to the destination, which in many situations enables you to force the opponent to make a move when it's a bad time for him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(chess)&quot;&gt;Triangulation&lt;/a&gt; is a classic example of this tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, losing tempo or just getting back to the previous square is usually bad in openings or even middlegame, although that depends on the situation. But in the endgame, deliberate loss of tempo is often maneuver which wins you the game (of course, if situation requires so).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example from wiki:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[fen &quot;8/1p1k4/1P6/2PK4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1&quot;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If black would be on the move in this position, it would be clear victory for white, as after black King moves away, white can proceed either with his King or his Pawn (depending on the move). But white is on the move, so he must think of a way how to make it work. The answer is, lose a tempo with triangulation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[fen &quot;8/1p1k4/1P6/2PK4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1&quot;] &#xA;&#xA;1. Ke5 Kc6 2. Kd4 Kd7 3. Kd5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now black is on the move, which enables white to break through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are right in saying that loss of tempo is used &quot;only&quot; to put opponent in zugzwang, but the importance of this is greater than it might seem at first. For example, every classic mate endgame uses loss of tempo and zugzwang to get the opponent's King to the edge of the board and to mate him. You often use zugzwang without even realising that you used it. Look at the mate with Rook:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[fen &quot;1k6/7R/2K5/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1&quot;]&#xA;&#xA;1. Rg7 Ka8 2. Kb6 Kb8 3. Rg8#&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You aim to get your King to b6 when black King is on b8, so you can mate with Rook on 8th row. But you can't do that right away, as after 1. Kb6, black would get away with Kc8, and 1. Rh8+ would enable black to get away with Ka7. So in the process of getting to 8th row with your Rook, you deliberately lose a tempo with 1. Rg7 in order to win the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, to address your original question, Knight is not able to do that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[fen &quot;8/8/8/8/8/7p/5K2/5N1k w - - 0 1&quot;]&#xA;&#xA;1. Ng3+ Kh2 2. Nf1+ Kh1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If white could just get to the starting position with black on the move, it would be a quick victory (1... h2 2. Ng3#), but Knight can't lose a tempo, so it's impossible, which is why this position with white to move is a draw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1099" LastActivityDate="2016-04-20T13:21:58.837" CommentCount="0" />

So let's go back in time before the introduction of checkmate and reanalyse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In two-player chess checkmate is a situation where at the end of your turn all parties are certain that you will (be able to) capture the king on your very next turn (and in two-player chess there exist no reasons not to actually capture the king).  Because of this certainty of how the next two turns will play out (a doomed evasive move and a certain king capture), there is no point in actually playing those moves, so both can be (and have been in FIDE chess) eliminated from the game with no detriment to the game.  (Very much the same thing happens when a player forfeits the game upon realizing that the game is lost and there is no point playing any further.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if there are three or more players a third party can intervene on behalf of a threatened king and (unless the game ends when the first king is captured) there may be more pressing matters than capturing an opponent's king left in check (like defending your own king).  These differences make it impossible to say with certainty when king capture is actually going to take place before it actually happens, thereby invalidating the reasoning which allowed us to eliminate king capture from the (end of the) game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is of course possible to try and use a definition of checkmate that is equivalent to the full checkmate described above in two-player chess also in chess with three or more players.  Indeed checkmate is usually defined in an operational way that is equivalent to full checkmate in two-player chess: your king is attacked and you have no move that will result in your king not being attacked. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you try to use that definition in multi-player chess you will need to think about on which player's turns one can be checkmated.  If your king is attacked and you have no move that will result in your king not being attacked, because it is not even your turn, are you checkmated?  Apparently that was something you rejected, but then it becomes hard to say who checkmated you.  It is possible for example that the player before you causes your king to be attacked by moving one of their pieces out of the way of a third player's piece, and even causes you to not have any moves that result in your king not being attacked, even though they are not even checking you with any of their own pieces.  Have they checkmated you?  I think most people are inclined to say yes.  But if you want to know if they caused checkmate or not, then you need to be able to say whether or not you were already checkmated before their turn or not.  Thus you need a way to determine checkmate even when it is not your turn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One extreme is to say that every check from a player not immediately before you is checkmate (because as it is not even your turn you have no moves to remove that attack).  Another way is to pretend that it were your turn and see if you could do something.  I have recently even read rules for multi-player chess where it actually becomes your turn if you are checked, and the player whose turn it would have been had you not been checked continues after you (and you may or may not forfeit you actual next turn).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9531" LastActivityDate="2016-04-22T09:54:22.223" CommentCount="0" />

It does not develop a piece. I does not really fight for center control in an efficient manner. However, it does make the pawn on e5 weak to attacks, as it's further away from White's side of the board than it was on e4. Black should probably continue with 2...Nc6 to see if White really wants to play f4. However, ...e6 is not a bad move. One may argue about the question-mark, as 2.e5 is objectively speaking fully playable, but I feel that it is appropriate, as it makes White struggle for equality if Black plays for an advantage. This should never be the case for White in the opening - it should be the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2...e6 3.f4&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A logical continuation after 2.e5. It is reasonable to pre-emptively guard the pawn on e5 before Black decides to attack it. However, f4 is not a move that helps White's piece development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3...Ne7?!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it aims to develop a knight to f5, the same could have been accomplished by 3...Nh6. However, on h6 the knight wouldn't block the bishop on f8. This would have given Black more flexibility in what move to play next. Normally, when White has played e5 followed by f4, and Black already has a pawn on e6, the play ...Nh6 should be seriously considered, as White's bishop on c1 cannot attack it in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;4.Nc3, Nf5 5.Nf3, d5!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the ...d5 push. It is very logical, as it fights for center control. The exclamation mark may be superfluous, but the move is not bad. Alternatively, Black could have played 4...Nc6! This develops a knight, and it takes control of an important central square (d4). It also forces White to make a decision. What should White play? On 5.Bb5, it's possible to play ...d5! 6.exd6 e.p., Bd7! (the pawn on d6 isn't going anywhere) and Black has a great position, with all the light pieces having something to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;6.exd6 e.p., Qxd6?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental error that beginners seem to make all to often. The queen shouldn't be running around too much in the opening, as it can be easily attacked by the enemy, thus wasting too much time in the opening. What was wrong with the simple reply 6...Bxd6? Nothing was wrong with that move. The bishop &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;does just as much as a queen would on d6,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is less vulnerable to attacks by enemy pieces, as it's less valuable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;paves the way for bringing the king to safety on g8 with castling.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, when you choose between throwing out the queen and developing a light piece in the opening, you should develop the light piece. It's often too early to say where the queen will be useful in the earliest stage of a game. Note that again, 6...Qxd6 is playable technically speaking, but that's besides the point I'm trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;7.Bb5+&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strong alternative to this move is 7.Nb5! This move immediately punishes Black for playing out the queen too early, as after 7...Qxf4 8.d3!, and Black cannot defend the c7 square in a good way. White will be able to play Nc7+ shortly, picking up the a8 rook. After this reply, the best Black can do is to pull the queen back to either d7 or d8. None of this would have been the case if Black had taken on d6 with the bishop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;7...Bd7 8.Ne4? Qxf4 9.d3&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it's nice to attack the enemy queen, a whole pawn is not worth it. At least if White really gains very little as compensation for the pawn. Black can calmly reply with 9...Qc7, and White will be a pawn down for very little compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;9...Ne3??&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A game-losing blunder. It simply drops a piece for nothing after 10.Bxd7+! After this there isn't much to be done for Black, if White plays reasonably solid chess, which was what happened in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anybody feels like posting analysis of the entire game, then please do.

Does the engine actually use this data to decide how long to think on each move, or does it expect the GUI to tell it how to manage it's own time?  It looks like the engine handles this thinking on it's own, but as I've never actually gotten to the NEXT move, I'm not sure if it's actually doing time management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know these are horribly newbish questions, but all the reading up I've found on the UCI engine seems to just talk about one move, or analyzing a move, and I haven't found any examples of multiple moves in sequence, so I'm not quite sure how to play THROUGH a game on the UCI command line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10145" LastActivityDate="2016-04-26T06:49:50.100" Title="I'm confused by UCI Pondering and Time Control" Tags="&lt;engines&gt;&lt;programming&gt;&lt;uci&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" />

Then the GUI sends &quot;go ponder&quot;. This makes little sense to me, but UCI is very much a kludge. Note that the engine can actually ponder whatever move(s) it wants, but UCI tried to make it simple for basic implementations. From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shredderchess.com/chess-info/features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ponder&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;start searching in pondering mode.      Do not exit the search in ponder mode, even if it's mate!       This means that the last move sent in in the position string is the ponder move.        The engine can do what it wants to do, but after a &quot;ponderhit&quot; command      it should execute the suggested move to ponder on. This means that the ponder&#xA;move sent by the GUI can be interpreted as a recommendation about which move&#xA;to ponder. However, if the engine decides to ponder on a different move, it&#xA;should not display any mainlines as they are likely to be misinterpreted&#xA;by the GUI because the GUI expects the engine to ponder on the suggested move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the GUI simply sends &quot;ponderhit&quot; when it is applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to resend the position string, but to only send &quot;ponderhit&quot; is to ensure that the engine continues its current search in the pondered position, rather than starting a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ponderhit&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  the user has played the expected move. This will be sent if the engine was&#xA;  told to ponder on the same move the user has played. The engine should&#xA;  continue searching but switch from pondering to normal search.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, UCI tries to be &quot;stateless&quot;, which is really it's big error IMO, as it makes everything natty. Pondering is a prime example of when the engine can really do whatever it wants (even the protocol says explicitly). The &quot;ponderhit&quot; command's action is determined by the &quot;position fen ... moves&quot; string that was already sent before the pondering began. So in that sense the GUI still sends the board state (this is completely awkward in my opinion, particularly if you want to ponder more than one move, but that's UCI for you).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Engines can/should use their own time management based on &quot;wtime&quot; (and/or btime/winc/binc). Again it's a bit confusing with UCI, as the GUI is supposed to be in somewhat total control (like with opening books), but then has some leeway when allowing the engine to allocate its own time (you can use &quot;go movetime&quot; if you want the GUI to control time management, assuming the engine complies).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can look at a log of how a GUI communicates with an engine such as Stockfish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GUI -&amp;gt; engine1: position startpos&#xA;GUI -&amp;gt; engine1: go wtime 100000 winc 1000 btime 100000 binc 1000&#xA;engine1 -&amp;gt; GUI: bestmove e2e4 ponder e7e6&#xA;GUI -&amp;gt; engine1: position startpos moves e2e4 e7e6&#xA;GUI -&amp;gt; engine1: go ponder wtime 98123 winc 1000 btime 100000 binc 1000&#xA;[user or other engine plays the expected e7e6 move]&#xA;GUI -&amp;gt; engine1: ponderhit&#xA;[engine keeps thinking]&#xA;engine1 -&amp;gt; GUI: bestmove d2d4 ponder d7d5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or if the pondered move wasn't made, then a new &quot;position&quot; string is sent instead of &quot;ponderhit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9419" LastEditorUserId="9419" LastEditDate="2016-04-26T06:49:50.100" LastActivityDate="2016-04-26T06:49:50.100" CommentCount="1" />

The guys on Stackoverflow wouldn't have the knolwedge to answer you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this is definitely your fault since Stockfish wouldn't give you &lt;code&gt;a2a3&lt;/code&gt; unless you have screwed up something. But why a2a3? That's because Stockfish always try to move a pawn before anything else. The way how the bitboard is encoded, it'd start its search from a1 to h1, then a2 to h2, a3 to h3 etc. The a2 white pawn is the first pawn it sees, so it tries to move it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we've established it's your fault, however, it's not possible for us to determine the cause because we don't have your source code. But I can give you some hints, you'll need to experiment yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have killed the standard input too early. I don't quite understand why you would do &lt;code&gt;stockfish.stdin.end();&lt;/code&gt;. Stockfish assumes the standard input/output works, always works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have failed to setup the bitboard. I'm confident you'd get the error unless you let Stockfish to setup it's internal data structure. Have you done it? The code for doing it should be in the main() function, did you run it? You can't just run the UCI loop directly, it wouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did you host the engine? Did you host it in the same address space as the server? Note that the engine assumes it's in a different address space because this is how a desktop GUI would work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Print out everything you send to Stockfish and everything you receive from the engine. &lt;strong&gt;Don't&lt;/strong&gt; assume your commands would work, &lt;strong&gt;print&lt;/strong&gt; everything to a text file. Run the commands in a command line. Stockfish could give you nonsense if one of your commands is not right. You'll have to verify it by trying yourself, don't assume anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you still can't figure out what's happening. &lt;strong&gt;Put&lt;/strong&gt; a breakpoint in the UCI loop and follow it. There has to be something, a condition that makes your search terminate immediately. Don't be afraid, you should be able to debug it yourself if you follow the code step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you done &lt;code&gt;ucinewgame&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely it's (2), a common mistake in chess programming.

Playing the KID as Black will force you to sacrifice pieces now and then to win istead of losing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically what you need to do is to start appreciating initiative by experiencing it for yourself. Otherwise it becomes very difficult to dare making risky decisions based on tempo and piece activity, if you've never done it successfully before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on what you wrote, I guess you tend to play mainly rather slow and positional setups in the opening. Then you have to expect it to be rather difficult to learn about this style of play, as you are probably not very familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other things you can do is to look for inspiration in games by e.g. Kasparov.

A knight pawn on the fifth rank has better winning chances than a rook pawn on the sixth rank. There are two reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The king has squares on the adjacent rook file to try to avoid perpetual check&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The exchange of queens is less likely to lead to a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Dqui.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Dqui.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Bishop Pawn&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A bishop pawn offers the best winning chances. One reason is that there is no drawing zone in the opposite corner for the black king if the pawn is on at least the fourth rank. If the pawn is on the fifth rank the defender's chances are small unless the king is in front of the pawn. A pawn on the sixth rank wins unless the defending king is in front of the pawn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ORF9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ORF9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Centre Pawn&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A central pawn has better chances to win than a rook pawn or knight pawn, but not as good as a bishop pawn.

If you mean, never really studying specific things then you will be lacking in a few areas. Notably:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openings&lt;/strong&gt;. You will struggle at a high level without theory unless you are Magnus Carlsen. Most top level Grandmasters have memorised thousands of opening lines, and understand them extremely well. If they did not know these, they might be able to work out the correct answers, but they would use a lot more time to do so (which would be a very significant handicap). The computer age was leading towards theory being critical for most games, but Carlsen plays many novelties, showing that opening theory is not completely necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endgames&lt;/strong&gt;. You might be able to work it out for yourself, but again, you'd have to be a super genius to naturally get this at a top level. Endgames have many specific things that would be much easier to learn if you just studied the theory. Without theory, it will take you much longer to learn the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are probably more things.

Actually, White only recovers the tempo &quot;lost&quot; on his second move (exd5). Someone even called it &quot;theoretically inferior&quot; based on the first few moves.  The Scandi is perfectly playable, and there are several strong GMs playing it regularly. Tiviakov, Kramnik, Ivanchuk, Karpov on his older days just to name a few, and even Carlsen has tried it out. The Scandinavian Defence - especially the 3...Qd6 variation - equalizes in almost every possible line against 1.e4. The &quot;problem&quot;  (if there is one), is not the irrelevant Nc3 threatens queen discussion, but the fact that it can be difficult to win with lots of games with Black. At amatur level this is hardly a problem, because most players with White doesn't have a clue about how to play against the Scandi. At higher levels, the main line is : &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qd6 4.d4 Nf6 5.Nf3 c6 (also a6 is played, and GM Kovalenko's aggressive Bg4). Then only 6.Ne5 puts any pressure on Black. Earlier also 6.g3 was considered strong, but it has been well neutralized by Black thanks to the efforts of GMs Tiviakov and Kontronias. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 6.Ne5 play goes:  6...Nbd7 and White has three main tries: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;f4 (Shirov's idea)&#xA;7.Bf4&#xA;7.Nc4&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Bf4 variation is not a problem anymore. Black equalizes quite easy. &#xA;7.f4 and 7.Nc4 is more challenging, but Black has found ways to maintain the balance and the theory of these lines are quite heavily developed. Playing Scandi (at least on a higher level) requires knowledge of these lines, and how to handle these quite complex middlegames. It is not enough to know just the opening lines of the scandi, it also important to know these middlegames, and you will need strong endgame abilities to win (or draw) these positions - both as White and Black. This is the &quot;problem&quot; of the Scandinavian (and in all other openings I guess).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wish you all best of luck playing both sides of the Scandiavian Defence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10191" LastActivityDate="2016-05-02T17:17:02.103" CommentCount="0" />

In another room his opponents sat with regular boards and pieces in front of them, and their and Najdorf’s moves were transmitted to each other via standard chess notation using a microphone. This performance exceeded his own previous world record of 40, set in 1943 in Rosario, Argentina. Until a few weeks ago, since 1947 only one player had played as many as 35 blindfold games at once under well-controlled conditions. That successful master was Marc Lang of Günzburg, Germany, who handled 35 opponents in November of 2010, surpassing blindfold champion George Koltanowski’s still-existing European and pre-Najdorf world record of 34 simultaneous games set in Edinburgh in 1937 (in 2009 Lang had set a new German record of 23). Lang’s only remaining goal was to exceed Najdorf’s 45 games and thereby gain the world record. &lt;strong&gt;For the past year he has been preparing to do just that, which he accomplished by playing 46 opponents on November 26-27, 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blindfoldchess.net/blog/2011/12/after_64_years_new_world_blindfold_record_set_by_marc_lang_playing_46_games/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blindfoldchess.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1108" LastActivityDate="2016-05-05T08:51:28.273" CommentCount="1" />

Making good moves in fast chess results from remembering positions or patterns. The repretorie of strong moves in a given position developes when you have already evaluated similar positions and made similar moves.

At move 31, you make life more complicated for yourself with 31...b5. Why not offer to trade queens with 31...Qe4, which needs almost no calculation?

I went further and thought when seeing your variation (d5) that it reminded me of certain variations of the Ponziani, with one single (huge) difference: white has not yet played c3. So, taking on d5 to implement Cc3 came to my mind, with the following variation (as a sample and not definitively concluding - and with computer assistance): &#xA;1.e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; 3.

Of course, the line first proposed by another intervenant is less &quot;messy&quot; and more clear-cut but I just propose another option. It remains to you to make your choice.  The variations we both propose are different in nature. The first respondent proposes you a material advantage  in exchange for the bishop pair (for what it is worth without convenient development). My variation also proposes a material advantage but doesn't surrender the bishop pair. Furthermore, my variation keeps the center solid (pawns in the center), somehow avoiding counterplay and hindering free piece play on black's part. The idea of d5 is thematic, of course, but premature and clearly inferior but it has one advantage: you are on your own and one single misstep and problems appear. It could be interesting in blitz play but not more, i think. The positions arising after d5 should be examined by you (and possibly others) with computer assistance to refute your missteps in analysis and to get an idea of how to handle various responses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10087" LastActivityDate="2016-05-10T07:33:58.547" CommentCount="0" />

You are speaking about openings and your problem is not about opening. When you say you have been playing closed openings for years, what do you really mean? Are you playing those out of interest or out of fear or prudence? I would advice you, given your rating, to restudy from the beginning the game of chess. Study all of its history with commented games and try to make progress tactically. Practise and practise again until you get a grip on tactics: this is the major step to mastering the basics of chess. You should be prudent: books for beginners and weaker players always insist on ideas, and they are right, but you should not forget that a minimal mastery of concrete tactical chess is unmistakenly necessary. There is no progress without this. Playing closed openings closes road for your progress. There are good books for you to study: just think of Yusupov's course in several volumes, for instance. You read the book with a board aside (computer also) and you think what you want to play and what could be annoying to you. Then when reaching your conclusion, you look up with computer assistance and finally you try to figure out why computer moves are better than yours. This is a very rude way to learn but you will make progress. You can keep on playing your openings, they are not bad, but play them with an open mind and try to master tactics. You rating will then go up. I know this is not comfortable, but there is no such thing as comfort when trying to progress. Maybe you will even lose elo points in the beginning, and so what, if you risk nothing you get nothing. Just try, it's a game, open and closed. Open games are more dangerous in the short term BUT you have to master them to understand what underlies closed positions when those get opened.

To answer it, it would be necessary that you provide more détails on your &quot;personal&quot; situation. I mean, what are your strength (elo?), your age, your experience, your motivation (time to learn), your aspirations? How long have you been playing, are you a newcomer to chess? What did you play until now with white (with what results), what is your preference: slow, positional, tactical play, both, manoeuvering, middlegame, opening rapidity of motion/development, do you like open or closed games. For instance, but just for instance, if you like slow positional, almost contactless play, you can adopt (with modifications to be made for opening developments since publication) the repertoire proposed by Emms in Attacking with e4 (an &quot;old&quot; but very good book). However, to continue with my example, if you are young and you want to learn and to make progress, there is a precondition for progressing, it is mastering tactical basic schèmes (all of them) and more advanced ideas, to be acquainted with tactics of everyday (by this i don't mean basic themes, as someone else understood here, but the subtle interweaving of themes and foremost the concrete calculation necessary to accomplish plans), and so on. Which kind of French positions do you like and predominantly, what don't you like as regards pawn structure types? You can furthermore take into account the frequency of types of positions played in the opening you choose. I mean if you play the Rubinstein French and you like a specific variation and dislike other variations and the statistics say the variations you don't like represent 80% of the played French Rubinstein games, then you should make a more pragmatic choice to increase your chance of getting a convenient (to you) position type. This does, as is quite evident, not mean that you can avoid all unwished variations. &#xA;Furthermore, you should be aware, should you wish to play a reversed French, that the difference between the french and the reversed french is the fundamental nature of it.

I'd like some feedback and suggestions on how you use The Week In Chess pgn/cbv files for study. Here are a few things I do with them:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Play from a won position&lt;/strong&gt; - here we go down the list of decided games and using a chess engine, get to the point in the game where the evaluation flips to +/- 2.00 or greater. Play the game out at that point against the computer and try and find a winning continuation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Update your repertoire&lt;/strong&gt; - Using the ECO Keys, gather the games in your main repertoire from the TWIC file and at least review those games and possibly add them to your repertoire games database. This allows you to see potential new ideas and how to play certain middle-games coming out of your repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Hold the Draw&lt;/strong&gt; - Take a drawn game and jump in and play it against the computer and try and hold the ending with 10-20 moves left. Try it from both sides, alternatively. This ii a great way to understand endgame play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Defend your King&lt;/strong&gt; - this is the opposite of #1 - Take the losing position and try to defend it. You might want to consider reducing the +/- to  a pawn down on the comp. valuation. This is good defensive practice when in a worse position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just some thoughts...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10233" LastActivityDate="2016-05-11T16:24:13.077" Title="How to use TWIC files for study" Tags="&lt;draw&gt;&lt;positional-play&gt;&lt;best-practice&gt;&lt;repertoire&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="4" />

If you compare the common pawn structures of the openings KID, Gruenfeld, Queen's Gambit, Queen's Indian with the Dutch you will notice a substantial difference: The existence of the black f5-pawn and white's pawn on e2 rather than e4. The black pawn structure of Stonewall Dutch is usualy c6-d5-e6-f5 whereas the pawn structure of Leningrad Dutch is f5-e6-d6 (and c5 or c6 depending on circumstance). I will limit the answer to the Stonewall Dutch to be more precise however this should also be applicable to other openings of Dutch flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examining the stonewall formation following the principle of optimal piece activity - that is all pieces should be placed where they are most active - we can easily see that the white-squared bishop would not be placed actively on anywhere but g2. The only comparison could be with the d3-square (we can eliminate other squares quickly: c4 impossible, e2 too passive having little or no perspective).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the d3 and g2 squares the important difference is the bishop on d3 targets the kingside and g2 targets the queenside. We know for a fact that Black plans to play on the kingside which means her/his pieces will be placed on or near to the kingside. Following the principle of &quot;attack your opponent's weaker spot/side&quot; we see that bishop on d3 will not make much sense as it will, so to speak, &quot;bite on granite&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the bishop on g2 has multiple purposes: Putting pressure over the long diagonal and adding an extra defense for the king.

This will help you recognize tactical patterns and subconsciously organize them into themes. A good book will also provide an appropriate amount of puzzles to each theme. Tactical themes usually occur with each other, and capitalizing on that usually involves a sacrifice, and the variations leading is called a combination.

Even though it might seem to point you in the right direction to solve the puzzle, that's not really the point. The point is to get used to seeing these themes in action so you can quickly recognize them in your games or when solving difficult tactical puzzles in earnest. In this regard, I use Renko's Intensive Course Tactics for thematic solving practice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thematic Study to understand all the different tactical nuances&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Master tactics problem-solving at 70+ percent success rate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Blitz makes you lazy in calculation, so be careful.

Then, you should calculate and evaluate these candidate moves one by one, and determine which one is the best. This is how you would play in a real game, and thus your tactical training should be like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can't spot the tactic (get the problem wrong), then you know that something is wrong with your thinking process, and you can correct it immediately. For example, if you spotted all the appropriate candidate moves, but, after calculation/evaluation, didn't find a winner, and thus settled for a &quot;positional&quot; move, then you know that there's an issue in your calculation; maybe you didn't remember to find all candidate moves at every move, and thus missed something. Or perhaps you couldn't visualize a long sequence, and now you know you have to get better at this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is assuming you know how to improve every aspect of your thinking process. There are many free online resources, particularly youtube, that tell you how to train to improve certain things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think that 10-20 difficult puzzles is plenty, as long as you apply your thinking process to each, and remember to diagnose/improve your thinking process at the end of each puzzle.

The only point of ...h6 seems to be to avoid the line 3...Nf6 4.Ng5, but this line is not dangerous to black at all. Play can continue 4...d5 5.exd5 Na5, and black will have good compensation for his pawn in this well known line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason you may experience difficulties as black after 3...h6 is because you don't achieve any activity with h6, and you let white take control over the center with 4.d4. This is a Scotch Game / Scotch Gambit where white has the useful move Bc4, while black has the much less useful h6. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, you should not play 3...h6 as black, but instead either 3...Nf6 or 3...Bc5 as black, which take control of the center and activate your pieces. These openings, the 2 knights (Nf6) and Giucco (Bc5) are very solid openings for black. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, even though a GM used to experiment with this line, it doesn't mean you should play it. Hikaru has played an early 3.Qh5 before in open games (1.e4 e5), but that doesn't make the move good. If black responds properly, white will have no chance to secure an opening advantage. While Hikaru can outplay many GMs even in worse positions, for non-master players, there's no reason to play a sub-optimal opening that has no surprise value (unlike 1.b4 or 1.g4, which can catch opponents off-guard). Thus, one of 3...Bc5 or 3...Nf6 is what you should do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*If you are set on playing 3...h6, then you will have to accept a slightly worse position as black. He has wasted time with h6, and gives white an opening edge. An awkward queen might be one of these problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10283" LastActivityDate="2016-05-15T02:49:59.190" CommentCount="8" />

Note how few variations I have included in my analysis at this stage. What is there is basically just my impressions of the game soon after the game was finished. Instead I have focused on trying to remember my thought process during the game, and write it down in words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, when doing my analysis in this fashion, what can I learn from my game and my own mistake?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example it becomes very clear: I realized that I played too quickly in a critical stage of the game, when I thought I had seen all the way to the end. I became too excited. Thus, it will be easier for me to recognize this happening in future games, and I will have a chance to make myself slow down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This particular lesson will not be available for me to read in any book. I will only be able to learn it through experience if I try to remember as accurately as possible what happened during a game where something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the true reason why analysis of your own games is so good for self-improvement. Well-done analysis will reveal things about your game that you cannot find very easily elsewhere. It is important to analyze your games yourself, without the help of computers in the preliminary stages. This is to ensure that you think back on your experience during the game, without being distracted by the computer lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computers should be used as a final touch, when you feel like you cannot think of anything else that was noteworhty in the game, to check how sound your analysis is. Do not remove your original analysis! Keep it, and note where the computer suggests improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; The reference database is used in the opening to quickly reveal opening mistakes. It is not a bad idea to include references to master games where the master played a better move than the move played in the game.

If we were to consider the moves that white has, we can say that all of them are equal: all of them lead to draws, given black's best responses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we somehow solved all of chess, and somehow managed to investigate all the variations, I'm guessing we would see that every single first move leads to a draw with best play. Hence, 1.d4 and 1.e4 are equal in this sense. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when you mention &quot;classical principles&quot;, this is a little different from theory. General principles are resultant from many observations of positions. For example, &quot;develop pieces&quot; in the opening follows from the fact that development allows you more activity, and hence more ability to restrict the opponent's activity. However, a theoretical opening line (like the poisoned pawn variation of the Sicilian Najdorf) may include good moves that blantantly violate these classical principles, yet still work. There are always exceptions to general principles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, both 1.d4 and 1.e4 are great in following the classical view of chess: occupy the center with a pawn, and open lines for quick development. A move that would follow classical chess, but would be still viable, would be 1.g3, which is more of hypermodern chess. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10283" LastActivityDate="2016-05-17T06:25:34.410" CommentCount="0" />

I think &lt;strong&gt;ECO C&lt;/strong&gt; could be useful here...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2042" LastActivityDate="2016-05-18T00:35:58.800" CommentCount="0" />

Learning Java all by myself, I followed a few guidelines online and have come up with something pretty nice. What I would like to do now is modify my game and make a Fischer Random chess/Chess960. For those of you who don't know what Chess960 is, basically, the first row of given pieces to both players is random. You can read more about it on Wikipeadia: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what I have done so far:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NewChess.java;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package newchess;&#xA;&#xA;import java.util.*;&#xA;import javax.swing.*;&#xA;public class NewChess {&#xA;

Try making a Craigslist ad that advertises your club and make sure to put a note in there that there's players of rating X that are seeking challengers.

For a higher rated player, even in a drawn position, the only two results are a win and a draw. Obviously, sometimes he loses, but that chance is much smaller than the chance that he wins. The higher rated player doesn't take a draw because he can usually get more from playing on. Secondly, the higher rated player knows that you will be frustrated if he grinds for the next 100 moves. Each move increases the chance you make a mistake, and eventually you get so bored of the position you make a mistake and lose the game. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: Don't offer draws against higher rated players unless it's three move repetition or a forced draw.

It is purely mental, you have to adopt the right attitude, neutralizing any psychological negative interference. For this, of course, there is a prize, you will have to control also and eliminate positive advantages during the game, by this I mean not getting overoptimistic when obtaining an advantage - whether psychological or real.

Simul players use intuition heavily to find good moves quickly. This is not possible in complicated positions, where a lot of time needs to be taken to calculate many lines. This is where the simul master has the most trouble. Generally, steer the game to quieter play, or make sure to only enter complications that clearly favor you. As a corollary of (1) and (2), you should try to defeat the weaker players quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) Offer a few early draws.

I am 2350 USCF and I have a higher winrate against 2400s (around 75%) than even 2100-2200s (40-50%). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on ratings aside (only you can say if the true issue lies there), often there is also a technical issue here as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People can fall into a situation where they feel comfortable playing against opponents who play &quot;correctly&quot;, but can't deal with people who play &quot;incorrectly&quot; or in an unexpected way. For example, high-rated player in chess might defend from an attack in a relatively orthodox manner, while a less experienced player might react by creating even more chaos and throwing pieces at you to throw you off-balance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only real suggestion I can offer to counter this is to not just spend all of your study time looking at situation where the opponent defends perfectly but also consider the unorthodox replies that might emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2) The last round has always been a struggle for me.

Knowledge of desirability of piece exchanges usually comes from having played many games, but it is probably also possible to mechanically extract this knowledge from a large collection of games played by skilled players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use an evolutionary process to determine piece values.  You start with a large collection of random piece values and hold one-on-one elimination matches (or maybe tournaments is better?) to determine some best fraction (half, top ten percent) of random piece values.  Then you create a new generation of random piece values through some method of combining values from that best fraction together with small random perturbations.  Repeat until the values stabilize.  The values you get will probably depend on the specific chess engine (and time controls) you use, but I don't know how strong that effect is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a reasonably good sense of where the values are, you may want to use the scientific method to answer specific questions, such as whether the value of your new pawn is more or less than half a knight.

Given black's pawn structure it's easy to see that neither the &lt;code&gt;f8&lt;/code&gt; bishop nor the &lt;code&gt;a8&lt;/code&gt; rook could have escaped the structure, thus they must have been captured on the 8th row (by a white knight for example). This leaves us with the &lt;code&gt;h8&lt;/code&gt; rook, for which there's only one plausible choice left, namely having been captured on the &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt; square by the &lt;code&gt;a3&lt;/code&gt; pawn. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As for white, the only missing piece is the rook, which must evidently have been captured on the &lt;code&gt;g5&lt;/code&gt; square by the &lt;code&gt;h6&lt;/code&gt; pawn. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we arrive at the &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; question: which rook could have logically been captured first, the one on &lt;code&gt;g5&lt;/code&gt; or the one on &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt;? Surely if the black &lt;code&gt;h8&lt;/code&gt; rook is to be captured on &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt;, it must first have been freed by the white rook being in turn captured on &lt;code&gt;g5&lt;/code&gt;, but that's impossible, as the &lt;code&gt;h8&lt;/code&gt; rook being taken off on &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;very thing&lt;/em&gt; that must have freed white's &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; rook in the first place! Which leaves us with one remaining logical possibility: White's &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; rook must have been &lt;strong&gt;the one&lt;/strong&gt; coming out and subsequently captured on &lt;code&gt;g5&lt;/code&gt;, which then in turn frees black's &lt;code&gt;h8&lt;/code&gt; rook, to come out and be taken off on &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt; by white, which finally freed the &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; rook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the rook you see currently on &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; is actually the rook coming all&#xA;the way from &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; (once freed), with the original &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; rook having been&#xA;lost on &lt;code&gt;g5&lt;/code&gt;. Given this sequence as the only possible logical sequence&#xA;leading up to the current position, white cannot castle, as for&#xA;castling to be allowed, neither the king nor the rook must have&#xA;moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of puzzles usually go under the category of retrograde analysis, where unlike usual chess puzzles where the intent is to find the best moves/tactics or mates, in retrograde problems it's rather often just a logical question that can be answered by considering the basic rules of the game, and trying to find the only logical sequences (not move by move though, just the necessary ideas) that could have led to the position given in the puzzle. So if you're not familiar with these kinds of problems you may indeed find it difficult to attack them at first. Retrograde problems in chess are really fun to solve, specially as soon as you get the handle of them and start solving the real difficult ones. The solving process is really similar to that of a detective solving a crime, since if you think about it, you're given some clues and trying to figure out what could and could not have happened ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum after some comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This is regarding which of the black rooks may have been taken off on &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt;, although this fact leaves the proof unperturbed.&lt;/em&gt;) The &lt;code&gt;a8&lt;/code&gt; rook is trapped on the 8th row, as the only possible way for it to escape the 8th row would be via the h-file, which once opened (i.e white losing the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; rook on &lt;code&gt;g5&lt;/code&gt;) would first let the original &lt;code&gt;h8&lt;/code&gt; rook out. Of course you can always assume the &lt;code&gt;h8&lt;/code&gt; rook and &lt;code&gt;f8&lt;/code&gt; bishop were for example first taken off by a knight, then the &lt;code&gt;a8&lt;/code&gt; rook was the one coming out to get captured on &lt;code&gt;b4&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Nc6&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Qe6&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Kd7&lt;/code&gt; to open the 8th row), but for the purpose of the puzzle it won't matter, as in either scenario white wouldn't be able to castle as the same arguments hold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3594" LastEditorUserId="3594" LastEditDate="2016-05-25T11:03:07.853" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T11:03:07.853" CommentCount="7" />

So, there is no way out: you will have to master several positions transposing into sicilian territory (partially or totally), would it be only for your own sake and progress in chess. What you can do is playing different style positions. The sicilian has a wide scope of possibilities (closed, b3 and so on). Anyway, avoiding open sicilian will impede your progress (tactically, positionally and strategically). What you should do is, if you still want to avoid open sicilians, learn to pay less studied and theoretically analysed positions, possibly avoiding potential (but not sure) immediate defeats. Bad Bishop's proposal is interesting but entails you do not play e4 at the first move. Furthermore, with black you could anyway have to face a reversed sicilian. Sicilian structures are fairly universal in normal or reversed order. You cannot avoid them all, you can just choose less studied options and as a consequence avoid learning certain types of positions and so impede yourself getting a view of chess as a whole, whether tactically, positionally and strategically.

Looking through my reference database, White has an excellent score after 10.Re1.&#xA;Black needs to reply with 10...d5 not to be clearly worse, because of the weakness on e6(White can just crash through if Black is careless). After this there aren't many games, but White's score after 11.c4 is 73.3% in 15 games. The computer evaluates the position as approximately +0.20 for White, which indicates that White has full compensation for the pawn. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't hard to imagine. White has a development lead, has a weakness on e6 to work on, open lines for bishops and rooks etc. It is essentially a very sound gambit. The only reason why the computer gives White just +0.20 eval is because computers do not tend to make mistakes that humans make. They can handle scary looking positions in another way than humans can, and they don't make tactical errors. If you look through the games played after 11.c4, you will notice that virtually every black player has played a game-losing move at move 13 in this line (after 11... bxc3 12.Nxc3, Nxc3 13.bxc3, Be7?? and now White obtains a winning advantage after 14.Nf5!). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that the position is too expensive for Black to enter just for a pawn.

Now that chessbase.com web page is dated 2015. Has it cited information which is out-of-date? Or has the #226 been cooked? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTR cited a #292 by Otto Bláthy and correctly stated that its starting position is illegal. So to assess the above #226's acceptability, it is worth looking at its diagram to see if it is legal. It is, just. Four black pawns have made 8 captures b7xa6, c7xb6xa5, d7xc6xb5xa4, e7xd6xc5. White has 7 units, so those captures were of all but 1 of White's 9 missing units.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All those 8 captures were on the queenside, but White is missing all 4 kingside pawns. Black has 13 units, so White has made 3 captures. One was b2xc3, leaving 2. White could have also captured exd, but no more than 1 of White's kingside pawns can have made it to the queenside to be captured by a black pawn; no more than 1 was captured by a piece, so at least 2 had to promote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is just possible that only 2 White pawns promoted: the fP and gP. A piece captured White's hP. White's eP captured a piece on the d-file, then was captured by Black's eP on d7. White's gP captured Black's fP on the f-file, and White's fP and gP promoted on f8.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even if a problem's diagram cannot be reached without pawns promoting earlier in the game, that fact is not generally held against the problem, so long as it can be reached. What are regarded as blemishes are obtrusive pieces. Jørgensen's #226's diagram does not contain any obtrusive piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] Morse, Sir Jeremy.

They do not cover correspondence, simultaneous displays, handicaps, variants (other than chess960), computer chess and anything else which is not strictly OTB, although you are free to use a suitable subset for these other forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you are playing OTB there is no obligation unless you are playing in a formal competition which is governed by FIDE or an association of FIDE like your national chess federation. When I taught my kids to play, the touch-move rule came very late in my priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first time I played in a formal blitz tournament I had been playing competitions with standard rates of play for about 30 years. I was very familiar with touch-move. However the informal rule I was used to for blitz was that touch-move did not apply. Your move didn't become &quot;fixed&quot; until you pressed the clock even if you moved a piece, let go of it, moved it back and moved another one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that in the recent St Louis event in the Nakamura - Kasparov game where Kasparov violated touch-move quite blatantly, the commentators were unsure, Kasparov claims he was unsure and says (which you can actually see on the video) that he looked around at the arbiter for guidance to see if what he was doing was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In OTB chess played at standard time controls (each player having at least an hour for all their moves, more for stronger players) touch-move makes a lot of sense. Calculate your move in your head without touching or moving pieces around on the board and then make it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In chess played online via a computer interface the vast majority of games are played at blitz rates (each player having 10 minutes or less for all their moves). Time controls go all the way down to bullet - just one minute for all the moves. That it is even possible to play a sensible game at these rates is down to the technology: there is no clock to press (the technology handles that), you can make moves (with practice and the right mouse) much quicker and you can pre-move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last one of these is key. There is a lot of skill (and even character) in pre-moving and in a format where speed is vital pre-moving can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FIDE laws regarding which hand you press the clock with, touch-move, how you capture a piece or castle (use one hand only, please!), how you promote a pawn just don't make sense in correspondence chess or in online chess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4418" LastActivityDate="2016-05-27T09:55:30.200" CommentCount="0" />

White's strategy is: first, preserve the value, i.e. keep the position won for White; second, maximize DTM. (Why &quot;maximize&quot; and not &quot;minimize&quot;? I don't know, but in the above line White has only one value-preserving option at each move anyway, so it doesn't matter.) Black's strategy is to challenge White to find the unique value-preserving move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every move in the above line is optimal for the player's strategy. In the cases of Black's 20th and 22nd moves, there is not one unique option which is optimal for Black's strategy, but for all Black's other moves the move given above is Black's only option which implements Black's strategy of giving White only one option which keeps the position won for White.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the identity and length of the longest decisive AUMS depends on what White's and Black's strategies are. Black's strategy of preferring &quot;restrict White to a unique winning move&quot; seems calculated to enable there to be long AUMSes. If, instead, Black adopts the strategy &quot;maximize DTM&quot;, then the game proceeds differently. 18...Ne1 is indeed Black's only option which gives White only one winning move, but it loses in 20 moves. By contrast, 18...Ne3 loses in 32 (i.e. keeps Black alive for 12 moves more); 19. Kc6 then wins in 32, and 19. Kc5 in 34.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the jargon explained:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;decisive: ending in checkmate, not in stalemate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AUMS: Absolutely Unique Move Sequence&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTC: depth to conversion (i.e. depth to capture, promotion, or the end of the game)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTM: depth to mate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTZ: depth to changing which ply is the earliest at which a 50-move-rule draw may be claimed (i.e. depth to capture, pawn-move, or the end of the game)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;value: whether the position is (with best play) won for White, won for Black, or drawn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upper-case DTC/M/Z refer to white; lower-case dtc/m/z refer to Black.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depth is measured in plies, where a ply is either a white move or a black move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haworth cites Conrady, 2003; van der Heijden #70232, (2010).

My question is about the reason why opening books focus only on finding an advantage for white rather than make life simipler for the reader and show how to obtain a good promising position with equal chances using the White pieces as a means of forcing one's will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my earlier question in this vein there was a lot of controversy over the value of winning versus drawing, which I find amazing because people don't seem to value draw as an outcome of a game of chess.

  <row Id="14527" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="14517" CreationDate="2016-05-30T22:17:09.737" Score="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the Russians (Filatov?, maybe even Karjakin himself?) brown-nosed to the media that every match is 50-50 odds on the face of it...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But more seriously, Carlsen's rating has consistently been 2850 plus/minus a small amount (20) for some time now, while Karjakin has been more volatile, currently 2775 (near his career best 2788 of July 2011). So I think a 75 Elo advantage in raw strength must be assumed from the outset. This is about 60% scoring per game, and if this were the only factor, then over 12 games then Carlsen should win 7.25 to 4.75 or so, or likely 3-1 with 8 draws. Mathematically, one can model it one way or another (Poisson process), and get that if Carlsen is 30% wins, 8% losses, 62% draws in any game (ignoring color as a first approximation), then he has a 86% chance of winning in regulation, 6% of losing in regulation, and 8% chance of reaching a tiebreak. So nominally a bit over 90% for Carlsen, by Elo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, that's the pure stats version (like Chess by the Numbers might give). What sort of &quot;corrections&quot; to raw Elo might one give here? First there is the &quot;hunger&quot; factor, which I tend to discount. Second there is the preparation work of each (and their armies of helpers), where Karjakin might have a slight edge. But even if Karjakin wins one full game by prep (rather unlikely, at best he probably gets a superior position in two or three games, with a lot of work still to do), Carlsen still has about a 75% chance of winning by the above Elo estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there is the &quot;grappling&quot; aspect, whether the strength of one player matches up against the weakness of the other, or vice-versa. This is where the chess knowledge of their styles and past meetings would come into play. Karjakin seems assured that his Queen's Indian Defense against d4 can hold as Black, and I'd expect him to play the Berlin against e4. On the other hand, Carlsen has shown himself quite happy to play Nf3 systems (including early g3), just to divert from theory, so I can't think this means much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for later in the game, I would say that Karjakin's technical capacity (endings, maybe also material imbalances), both in conversion and defense, is probably slightly superior to Carlsen's, maybe simply because the latter is never pushed so hard in this direction. But Carlsen has the clear edge in semi-dynamic positions (think Fischer), and I don't think Karjakin can hope to avoid these for 12 games (including 6 Blacks).  Finally, both seem to play &quot;messy&quot; positions reasonably well, though perhaps not like a specialist might (Morozevich, just to name a name).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this might be Karjakin's best meta-plan, to aim for chaos game-after-game, hoping that Carlsen cracks, and/or starts to doubt himself. Unfortunately, Karjakin's style is more typically &quot;small-ball&quot;, where he nibbles away with a small edge, first ensuring two results (especially on the Russian team, they would give him White on Board 2 or 3 against a 2650-2700, and expect him to grind out a win this way), and then slowly applying pressure for a victory. I don't see this as particularly that effective against Carlsen (or some other 2800ish players for that matter). On the other hand, Karjakin has previously shown himself to be adaptable in style to suit occasions, and if he objectively looks at the Elo calculation of above, might very well decide to play a bit out of character.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all to say nothing of the media circus and other side events that can cause disturbance to the players. Carlsen didn't face the &quot;Russian full-court psychology&quot; when playing Anand, but in the end I don't think it will affect him much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9419" LastActivityDate="2016-05-30T22:17:09.737" CommentCount="1" />

In 2006 Van Perlo beat out both Kasparov (MY GREAT PREDECESSORS V) and Rowson (CHESS FOR ZEBRAS). That’s stiff competition, and is all the more surprising since endgame books usually don’t get the nod. Clearly, VAN PERLO’S ENDGAME TACTICS is something special! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aside from its entertainment value, VAN PERLO’S ENDGAME TACTICS also gives you an interesting kind of instructive bang for your buck. Though you might know of all the basic tactical themes from your middlegame studies, the endgame offers up some odd tactical ideas that only apply in this final phase of the game (pawn promotions, strange King jigs, etc.). Thus, going over the examples from this book will prove to be quite instructive, while also being lots of fun. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ger Van Perlo died in 2010. However, an odd thing happened. I’ll quote the NIC website: “By chance, in 2013 publisher New In Chess discovered a previously unnoticed and unpublished extra batch of endgame tactics collected by the legendary Dutch correspondence grandmaster” [Van Perlo]. As a result, the book has gone from 480 pages to 608, and is even better than the original 2006 award winner. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended for players from 1200 to grandmaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.jeremysilman.com/shop/pc/Van-Perlos-Endgame-Tactics-p3851.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JeremySilman.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1108" LastActivityDate="2016-05-31T10:15:51.830" CommentCount="0" />

Now, you can try to exchange your g3 Pawn (Kf3 or Nf6 followed by g4), but that leaves you with weak h-Pawn which he can attack easily with his King (Kh6-Kh5) or/and his Knight (Nf5). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best thing to try (after b3 and after your King is a bit activated on e3-d3) is to get your Knight back to e4 (Nf6-Ne4) to defend g3-Pawn so you can proceed with your King to the Queen side:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[StartFlipped &quot;0&quot;]&#xA;[FEN &quot;8/p2N1pk1/1pn1p1p1/2p1P2p/5P1P/2P3P1/PP6/6K1 b - - 0 1&quot;]&#xA;&#xA;1...Na5 2.

The two examples that come to mind are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the great early players did not have actual titles (either because the titles had not been invented or because the systems for reliably attaining them had not been introduced). In this case, one might refer to Morphy or Philidor as a 'master', simply because calling them a GM/IM would be inaccurate. Also consider that when the title 'Grand Master' was first conferred, it was not just a title to hand out to players but a real statement that those five players were some of the best ever. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural:&lt;/strong&gt; As you noted in the question, many foreign (esp. Russian) books up until the 1980s or so use the term. I cannot say exactly why, but the usage is certainly meant to indicate that those people are deserving of respect as top-calibre players. Perhaps part of this is due to the fact that some top theoreticians were not acknowledged as being among the best practical players, and so this allowed them to be given the same level of respect as determined by the author. Hopefully someone more knowledgable in soviet chess culture can fill us in on this one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to the modern USCF system where a range of various master titles are (by comparison to earlier times and other areas of the world) given out like candy.

However, it is assumed below that OP is interested in improving, and thus I feel that some level of harshness is justified here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Playing for cheap tricks - because that is exactly what 18.b3 is - is not something a computer would do. You will never find an engine that &quot;understands&quot; the &quot;motivation&quot; behind playing such a move. It calculates variations, and notices that the move is just not good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you seem to be under the erroneous impression that this is not a desireable property for the engine under these circumstances. In the example position you give, of course 18.b3 is a bad move in every respect. It is good if and only if black is careless enough to take on c3. The move doesn't threaten anything, and it only gives black time to defend a lost position. As you have other ways of playing that, unlike 18.b3, won't jeopardize your winning chances, the move is correctly classified by the computer as a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically: you get a winning position, and you don't know how to win. Seeing no way to win, you play a move that isn't very good if black just ignores the knight on c3, hoping that your opponent blunders. You don't try to play the best move in the position. And yet you feel like there is a reason to object when the engine picks up on this? Remember that there is an iron clad rule when playing chess, that should always be followed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER UNDERESTIMATE YOUR OPPONENT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would absolutely not put it past a 1400 player to spot that 18...Bxc3 is a bad move in that position. Furthermore, playing in a way that relies on your opponent falling for 1-move traps, because thinking of better ideas is too much of a bother, is no way to improve. And if you don't want to improve, why does this question even need to be asked? There is no other obvious point in reviewing the games that you play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were in a lost position instead of a winning one, then your doubt would have been justified, as sometimes in such a situation, only the cheap tricks have a chance at succeeding. But if you have a good position, you shouldn't bash the computer for criticizing your way of handling the position. In analysis, you should under no circumstances assume that one side will make bad moves. Analysis is about finding the truth - not about making yourself feel better about your play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final note: if you really want to improve using analysis, you shouldn't rely on the computer for analyzing your games. Focus on trying to find the best moves in the position yourself. The computer can never explain the &quot;why&quot; of a position. That is something you need to figure out for yourself most of the time if you don't have the help of a strong human player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8300" LastActivityDate="2016-06-05T23:52:45.633" CommentCount="1" />

The idea being that you noticed that that bishop is absolutely required to remain on that a3-f8 diagonal or it's checkmate for you. Good job seeing that!

Look instead at a more threatening/limiting move for that bishop like a3. Black has no good place to which to move the bishop.

I recommend it for all levels; anyone between a FIDE rating of 100 and 9999. The scotch is also an acceptable choice i guess, but i recently learned that at the top level it's actually just a draw. The ruy lopez secures an initiative for white.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against the sicilian, either the open sicilian or the c3/alapin sicilian is a great choice. c3 sicilian leads to isolated queen's pawn positions, which are very good for understanding more about the game of chess. The c3 sicilian doesn't require a massive amount of theory either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against the french, just play the tarrasch I guess. The tarrasch is the most solid line against the french at the top top top level (in which almost nobody plays the french at the supergrandmaster level because it's passive and doesn't 'play for a win').&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against the caro kann, u can try 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 Bd3 which is pretty easy to play if you do a little of homework, though it might be kind of dry. The absolute best response against the caro kann is the advanced variation where you play e5, but it's actually hard to play and hard to get used to because black gets easy moves, and the pawn on e5 and d4 feels kind of over extended and loose. And playing c3 to hold the pawn chain together is never a good move in the main lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against the pirc, 150-attack or Classical system are good. Look them up if you ever face the pirc at ur level. It's rare. You can also try f4 (austrian attack), g3, and Bc4, though I don't actually recommend the austrian attack. It's about dead equal but not very drawish at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against the scandinavian, just the main lines. The scandinavian is also rare. Qd6 and Qa5 are two different systems and completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to go d4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can try the london system or just the main lines (d4 c4 Nc3 e4 setup). The London system is about equal (white wants to be slightly above equal), but it's super impervious, solid, and you'll broaden your understanding about chess, and there are a several grandmasters who play the london system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;London System = d4 Bf4 e3 Nf3 c3 Nbd2 h3 setup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you play the london system or the mainline d4 with c4, you are going to have to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grunfeld. The grunfeld is actually the best best best absolute best opening against the d4 if you go for the Nc3 mainline (1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5). The grunfeld is very sharp and a lot of grandmasters are facing a little trouble against the grunfeld. But, hey, grandmasters play d4 c4 setup, so it must be promising. The grunfeld's endgames are always superior to white's in the main lines because of the 2-to-1 pawn majority on the queenside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nimzo indian defense is also very solid and good for black, just right behind the grunfeld by a millionth of an inch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The slav is right behind the nimzo indian defense in soundness. The slav can both be sharp and solid. Also the semi-slav botvinnik is the sharpest opening in all of chess openings. The najdorf and the grunfeld are just a lil behind in sharpness but still super sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend one of the following:&#xA;-Mainline e4&#xA;-Mainline d4&#xA;-London System &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternates&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;-You can look at the English (c4)&#xA;-You can look at the catalan&#xA;-You can look at the Reti, but you really have to like it to be good with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;-Generally you want tactical and sharp openings if you're a beginner, because playing out their middle games will improve your tactics. e4 is sharper and more tactical than d4.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10501" LastActivityDate="2016-06-06T05:26:02.603" CommentCount="0" />

Thus A is not pawn: if so, White's pawn structure entails cxd3, exf3, hxg3. As Wes &amp;amp; Daniel pointed out, the way to let as many pawns as possible promote with as few captures as possible is for some pawns to capture pawns and then promote. For example White axPb lets White's a- &amp;amp; b-pawns and Black's a-pawn promote. Two such captures by White and two by Black let each side promote 6 pawns. But with each side making only two captures, no more promotions are possible. So each side has 2 original &amp;amp; 6 promoted A's, so A is not queen, but rook, bishop or knight. Moreover, every pawn either promoted or was captured, so no letter represents pawn.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; Which letter means king? Not A, C or E: White has 2 or more of each. Nor D, for then the Ds check each other. Therefore B.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; E is neither queen nor rook: if so, both kings would be in check. Nor is E pawn. Therefore bishop or knight. If E is bishop, White has promoted a pawn to bishop on a white square. But it has already been proved that there were 6 White promotions (to A) &amp;amp; that only 6 are possible. So E is knight.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; Queen is C or D. But there have been no promotions except to A, so queen is not C but D.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; A is not knight and so is rook or bishop. Suppose that A is bishop. Then there are 7 promoted bishops on white squares (3 white and 4 black) and 5 on black squares (3 white and 2 black). Each PxP allows 3 promotions all on the same colour square. So the total number of promotions on each colour square is a multiple of 3. So the supposition is false. So A is not bishop but rook.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; So C is bishop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10380" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T08:43:52.163" CommentCount="0" />

One can also discover a new plan, either by one's own thinking or by looking at the way an engine plays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes ideas are transmitted orally.

It is commonly known that there are over 9 million possible positions after just three moves.  Nobody is expected to explore all of them, not even the mighty supercomputers.  There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be lines which are simply not fully explored in every game we play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the early algorithms you learn when developing chess computers is min/max.  It's a rather blatantly obvious algorithm when you get down to it: the idea is that both players are trying to maximize their own benefit.  In min/max, we treat this as you trying to maximize your advantage, and they are trying to minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you play chess using the kind of thinking behind min/max, you quickly find yourself limited.  No two players are thinking exactly the same.  They value different kinds of positions, different tactics.  You may find that it isn't effective to model your opponent as trying to minimize your advantage.  You have to recognize that they are merely trying to maximize their advantage.  The two phrases, &quot;minimizing your advantage&quot; vs &quot;maximizing their advantage&quot; are closely related in many situations, but they differ greatly in others.  In fact, Chess often hovers in that meddlesome region where the position is so strange that both players are approaching it quite differently.  Nowhere is this more visible than in a gambit.  In a gambit, you offer something in exchange for an advantage that you find more valuable.  They don't have to take it.  However, in many situations they may decide that it is in their interests to accept the gambit.  Min/max cannot explain a gambit; it cannot explain why both players would want the same position for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, it is essential in Chess to get into the head of your opponent.  Grandmasters may do this for months, studying up on the play styles of their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An opponent can get into your head at any time.  Kasparaov v. Deep Blue may be the most famous example.  In one game, Deep Blue simply refused to accept an obvious materialistic move and found a more &quot;human&quot; move.  For the rest of the tournament Kasparov was &lt;em&gt;convinced&lt;/em&gt; there had to be a human helping Deep Blue out, and that psychologically destroyed him (even though the computer wasn't even aware of a psyche).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6885" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T22:04:56.457" CommentCount="0" />
