This could occur in a series regulator but this is inconsistent with the assertion of a shunt regulator from Organic Marble's answer. Of course we don't know where the shunt loads are.  Its possible that if the shunt is a direct short then the cells themselves are the shunt load and unused sections could still run hotter than connected sections.

However, the ship used a Jupiter gravity assist. It will reach 100 AU from Sun in 32 years, but most probably it will not be functioning after 2026, when it will run out of power. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voyager 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/em&gt; used multiple gravity assists, to reach their current speed. Voyager 1 reached 100 AU from Sun around 2006, after 29 years of flying. Voyager 2 reached that distance in 2012, after 35 years from launch. Both spacecrafts are still functional, but they can hardly power-up their scientific payload. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pioneer&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft also used Jupiter and Saturn gravity assists. Both ships are supposed to be over 100 AU from Sun since 2014. However, contact has been lost before they reached this distance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Trajectory details&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As seen above, it is possible to reach Sedna orbit in less than 30 years. Sedna will be closer in 60 years, but the difference will not be much (less then 10% from current distance). So, we could launch a probe now instead of waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As New Horizons showed us, it is possible to send a spacecraft directly into solar escape velocity. However, we can use gravity assists, to reduce flight time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every 12 years, Jupiter is in place for a &lt;em&gt;Jupiter gravity assist&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every 29 years, Saturn is in place for a &lt;em&gt;Saturn gravity assist&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every 59 years, both Jupiter and Saturn are in place for a &lt;em&gt;Double gravity assist&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A flyby mission would reach Sedna in 20 to 30 years. However, sending an orbiter or a landing probe will be very hard, if not impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Task - Flyby&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To send a flyby to Sedna is almost like the flyby New Horizons conducted to Pluto. We can use the same spacecraft design, only that we will need a far more efficient RTG (radioactive thermoelectric generator), so that it will keep functioning after 30 years. The probe will conduct a fast flyby, then it will spend a few years sending all data back to Earth. This kind of mission is feasible and affordable with current NASA budget. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Task - orbiter&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we send an orbiter to Sedna, we have two ways: First, we need to slow it down, to enter orbit. Second, we can send it with a very low speed, enough to enter orbit. The first method will require giant amounts of propellant and will dramatically increase ship weight at launch. One alternative is to use an ion engine, powered-up by the ship's RTG, to reduce speed in the last 10 years before encounter. However, the amount of energy still available at that time is limited. Sending a probe with little speed might be a solution, but it will reach Sedna in 100 years. At that time, its RTG would have declined energy production to a very low level and anyway there will be nobody from the building team to see the results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Task - landing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sending a lander to Sedna is even more complicated then an orbiter. However, if we conduct a fast flyby, we can use an &lt;em&gt;impactor&lt;/em&gt;, similar to the one used by Deep Impact mission. This will at least allow us get a close picture from the surface and see at impact site sub-surface composition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The main problem with Sedna is the amount of time needed for a flyby. RTG energy decay is the main concern. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Luminosity is lower than on Pluto, so cameras will need a longer exposure time. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mass and gravity of Sedna are unknown. We only approximate its diameter. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not known if Sedna has moons, rings or anything in orbit around it that could harm a spacecraft. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Communication delay is a problem. Sending a message to the ship, we will need an Earth day to get a response. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Signal power is decreasing by the square distance. Signal power at Sedna will be 6.5 times weaker then at Pluto, meaning that a spaceship will need 6.5 times more time to download all its findings. If we needed over an year to download data from New Horizons, we will need probably 10 years for a probe that explored Sedna. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since we don't know major data about Sedna (mass, gravity, orbital axis, possible satellites and space debris), there is a high chance of risk. The ship will need to conduct some preliminary research before flyby, then it will need some strong trajectory correction maneuvers. At first, it will scan for possible moons or rings, to analyze the risk of a collision, then it will determine rotation axis, to see what is the best flyby path. As it gets closer, the probe will get a low-resolution image of the far side of Sedna, then it will get high-detail resolution of its encounter side. Then, as it gets behind Sedna, the probe will capture a solar eclipse, to see if there is any atmosphere. Overall, these were the steps performed also by New Horizons on Pluto. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A similar mission to New Horizons, but with a more powerful RTG, eventually with the help of Jupiter and Saturn flybys, could get to Sedna in 20 to 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14629" LastEditorUserId="6816" LastEditDate="2016-07-28T16:03:39.427" LastActivityDate="2016-07-28T16:03:39.427" CommentCount="1" />

But the ortho-para conversion is&#xA;  slow, so if you just liquefy hydrogen, what you get is still 3/4&#xA;  ortho, and it slowly converts itself to para.

Due to planetary rotation you can use half the day to generate power and it will increase from sunrise until midday and then decrease until sunset - you can increase that amount by spacing and rotating the panels though, so let's assume we end up with effective 150 W/m².&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we use really efficient solar panels, we can probably generate up to 50 W/m².

I suspect this will be a \$10-\$20 million effort. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then they have to meet Planetary Protection concerns, which no doubt will add cost. This probably isn't a huge cost, but a few million.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will no doubt be much modeling, simulation development, and other such exercises to ensure that the Dragon will land, software re-writes, etc. No doubt this will be at least $20 million, quite possibly more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they have to pay to operate the spacecraft for at least 8 months, possibly as long as a year or longer, depending on how long it lasts on Mars. Again, this won't be a huge cost, I suspect NASA is allowing the use of the DSN to make this happen, but it is still a cost, at least to keep the operators required to make sure the spacecraft is working in order, maybe a few million.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of that adds up quite a bit.

One of the primary advantages could be in tremendous volume savings - by having a dedicated spot to do the majority of the spacecraft assembly, one could send up raw (read: dense) materials to feed into the assemblers on this station/array. The array could then process these into the required components through refining and sub-assembly. This doesn't result in any weight savings, however. This could also be useful for processing any asteroid materials, but that presents another suite of problems and issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another method, and one that is close to being tested, is sending up the raw material required for the largest structures on a spacecraft while sending up the assembled spacecraft bus. An assembly drone could then use the raw material to build the extra structure on top of the pre-built satellite bus (this being what contains the most complicated elements). This would be highly advantageous for building large orbital telescopes, reflectors, or antennae as there is no great way to pack large structures like this into launch fairings (look at the complexity involved in the JWST deployment for example). A few companies have received &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbir.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SBIR&lt;/a&gt; grants for concepts related to this (the company I work for being one of them - I'm too leery of saying what our tech is though).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in summary - the capabilities of the array matter. Assembly alone at the array would provide for some advantages. Assembly and some degree of fabrication extends these capabilities and the worth of such an array, and inclusion of refining allows for usage of materials acquired in space. Further capabilities in manufacturing electronics, silicates, organics, plastics, and so on would advance its worth to be tremendous (and I may have misidentified things here, my apologies).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some interesting links:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/spacetech/niac/2013phaseII_hoyt.html#.V5pxeLgrKUk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/spacetech/niac/2013phaseII_hoyt.html#.V5pxeLgrKUk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/news/IRG-Dragonfly-robot-UI/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/news/IRG-Dragonfly-robot-UI/&lt;/a&gt; - currently underway, attempt to build a large antenna in orbit using robotic methods&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16197" LastEditorUserId="1142" LastEditDate="2016-07-29T12:53:05.677" LastActivityDate="2016-07-29T12:53:05.677" CommentCount="7" />

The company that made it is run by a... not so nice fellow that didn't do a good job of building it. It has served limited use due to this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary cost savings could arrive through recycling of the materials onboard. This would allow for reusable utensils, reusable tools (tool broke? if you still have material, it can be reprocessed), purpose-made parts for performing experiments (recycling makes this not at all wasteful), and so on. Utensils especially are useful - if they can be recycled, they will be sanitized when the material is melted at its usual temps! Currently, astronauts must wash all of their utensils with wet wipes since running water isn't the best idea on the ISS. This generates a (hilariously silly) amount of waste in the form of nothing but wet wipes. Which also must be sent up as supplies. And the astronauts say that the utensils can get fairly gnarly after a while... so being able to print single-use recyclable utensils lowers waste generation, lowers supply requirements, and increases quality-of-life (in some small measure) for the crew. All large cost savings! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue isn't with the technical readiness of 3D printers for space station employment. Even the most basic of printers is capable of printing in zero-g in its stock form. The issue that requires some engineering is bed adhesion, and removal of the byproducts generated by melting ABS/PLA/Ultem-1010. These fumes can be hazardous and must be removed from the build volume with air cycling (or must be contained while the machine is running, then purged).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ERASMUS is the utensil recycling idea I mentioned - can see that it was funded here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parabolicarc.com/2016/05/06/nasa-selects-tethers-unlimited-sbir-awards/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.parabolicarc.com/2016/05/06/nasa-selects-tethers-unlimited-sbir-awards/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the same company/division is currently building this as well - probably not a coincidence, once you figure one of these out the rest are natural evolutions of the starter concept.

Depending on your resolution you may be asked to not capture (any) images without a license. The licensing process becomes more stringent with different wavelengths and higher resolutions. At some points (for some of digitalglobe's spacecraft they need to send their imagery directly to a 3 letter government agency first, before they themselves can see them).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that you'll need to comply with launch regulations, which are very unique to the launch vehicle, even within the cubesat community.

The thrust plumes tend to reduce the drag, countering in&#xA;  part the intent of firing the engines to increase deceleration. With&#xA;  enough of a thrust to drag ratio, this is not a show stopper, but you&#xA;  need to be able to predict how large the effect is to know if you have&#xA;  enough fuel. This impact on drag also complicates what happens when&#xA;  you gimbal the engine, which is part of the challenge in #4.

Mark the center and draw regularly spaced radial lines (“slices”) across the face of the plate.  Number the lines at the rim and duplicate the labels farther inward too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cut a ring off the plate, about 1 inch wide.  If you can, leave a tiny bit uncut at opposide sides so the ring is still attached at 2 points and can pivot at that location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tip the ring 60 degrees or so from the plate.  The &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; in drift is larger if the inclination is high, but lining up and sighting might be easier if not so high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cut tiny notches in the ring and remaining plate, and then a fine string can hold the contraption in place so it doesn’t flop around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for each marked line on the plate, sight where it lines up visually on the tilted ring now.  You need a right angle: get a small scrap of wood or carboard box and tape a large cardboard triangle to one face.  Now you can line up the bottom of the triangle with a line on the main plate and know it’s standing normal to the plate’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now see where the triangle touches the detached ring.  Each mark on the flat plate represents your sightline as the Earth turns. The corresponding mark on the arch is where the satellite is at that time.  So look at the &lt;em&gt;height&lt;/em&gt; to see that the sattelite appears to rise in the sky, and look at how its position will be to the left or right of your sightline: this is the side to side motion you see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where the arch meets the flat plate, you can approximate it in 2 dimensions as a horizontal ruler and a diagonal ruler.  The same length along the diagonal ruler will not not reach as far horizontally (East) so the rising sattelite falls behind the turning Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the arch, the highest point in the sky, the sattelite is directly overhead again. The setting part is a mirror image. So, you see it rise and drift left at first, then back to the right until it reaches the highest point, keeps going right as it sets, then back left again to set at the original position. Below the horizon it does the same thing upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If viewing at other than the equator (lift the plate up within the arch model) then the two lobes will be asymmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma#Analemmas_of_geosynchronous_satellites&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Analemma of Geosynchronous Satellites&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jqxJu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jqxJu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The figure 8 you show (taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and explained on that page) is related but different.

The probe would only be able to receive, and not send data using an ELF system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sonar is also a very bad carrier for information, it goes pretty far but there's too much attenuation and distortion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The surface ice is a real problem as well, as it also absorbs radio and it will prevent a probe underneath from being able to expose an antenna. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand how we would do this on Europa you don't have to look any farther than how we do it on earth.

Even the autonomous probes have to surface to send information. Navies across the world have spent a great deal of money to find ways to transmit data through water so that submarines can communicate while submerged, but they still have to send data through an antenna exposed to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So any probe we send will require a wire of some sort to send data back. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2981" LastEditorUserId="58" LastEditDate="2016-08-02T13:22:47.647" LastActivityDate="2016-08-02T13:22:47.647" CommentCount="4" />

For my model, I consider them constant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Model is not in scale, since variable are just a raw approximation of reality, but I consider Mars more challenging that the moon for some known characteristics already explored by rovers and satellites, and Mercury and Europa even more challenging just because of the mission constraint to actually go there (distance) and geology (ice surfaces, extreme temperature ranges).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interception between the wheel-based exploration and Moon LOT represent Apollo missions, while interception with Mars LOT represent martian rovers.

At sea level, it would be much less powerful than the F-1, but with better specific impulse - 310 seconds vs 263. Without going into too much detail, the result is that the first stage carries 1730 tons of LH2/LOX rather than 2160 tons of kerosene/LOX. However, depending on the exact mixture ratios in use, kerosene/LOX is about 3.5 times denser than LH2/LOX, so even with less fuel mass, the stage needs to get a lot bigger. If the 10 meter diameter is retained, the stage gets stretched from 42m to 92m -- a very long and skinny stage. More reasonable would be a 12-meter diameter, 63 meter long first stage. The overall rocket, all-up for an Apollo J mission, masses 2593 tons instead of 2970 tons.

About 50 m/s of the Saturn V's total potential is lost to drag; the larger diameter stage would probably incur another ~25m/s hit, but I don't want to go back and recalculate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To achieve the initial TWR requirement, 8 M-1s are needed, granting 1.21:1 TWR. As fuel mass was consumed and specific impulse (and thus thrust) increased, 2 pairs of them would likely be shut off over the course of the burn to limit acceleration for crew comfort, with 4 left running til fuel-out. Acceleration-by-time curves are shallower for higher Isp engines, so we may have a less efficient ascent than the Saturn V, so we might delay the engine shutdowns to make up some speed; this could mean a higher peak acceleration than Saturn V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total hydrogen carried by the rocket would be about 4x that of the Saturn V; presumably that would quadruple the ground storage requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that even though this rocket masses less in total, it probably costs much more because of first stage construction and transport logistics, engine complexity, and hydrogen handling, and on that basis it's somewhat inferior to the Saturn V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility would be using 16x SSME instead of 8x M-1. This probably couldn't have flown until the 1980s, but the sea level specific impulse is far better, 366s instead of 310s.

Starshot doesn't provide any math which makes me doubt their claim. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest assumption made by Starshot is that they can create a Fresnel lens with enough accuracy to improve the focus beyond the $3.25*10^{-7}rad=0.067''$ Longshot arrives at. Back of the envelope calculation: Note that they mention using 6 250 kW lasers on page 49, giving 1.5 MW of lazing power. To increase the power received by 1.5 million times the area subtended by the Earth over the total beam area would need to increase by $\sqrt{1,500,000}=1225$ (area of a circle). A focal length of infinity is theoretically possible, but would be dependent on the technology of the sail. Further, a thin lens would require a high number of grooves, reducing the efficiency of the lens. Lastly, they don't mention a data rate, so data may be able to be transmitted if sent VERY slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;did the technology change so much in 30 years?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.

Cubesats are often built out of aluminum. While there may be other ferromagnetic materials used, and current loops in the electronics, I think a well chosen servomotor could over come most issues. The biggest risk in my mind would be dealing with vibration on launch. Moving parts tend to have higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are rules about magnets (and just about everything else) on secondary payloads. The primary payload usually has many times more risk invested so they control almost everything about secondary payloads. The launch provider will have a say as well.

The Space Station has leaks, requiring regular resupplies of breathing atmosphere. People consume water and oxygen and produce carbon dioxide. That CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be continuously removed (watch &lt;em&gt;Apollo 13&lt;/em&gt;) from the breathing atmosphere lest the crew be poisoned. The crew can also be poisoned by trace contaminants in the breathing atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water from human waste in the Space Station toilets (both #1 and #2) is carefully scrubbed using specialized equipment. This waste water is then electrolyzed to form hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is vented overboard as waste while the oxygen goes back into the breathing atmosphere. The desiccated products of human #1 and #2 waste are either sent overboard or placed in modules that will burn on reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is removed from the breathing atmosphere via a complex and somewhat failure-prone set of machinery in both the Russian and US segments of the Space Station. Both use a two segment chamber in which one chamber selectively collects carbon dioxide from the breathing atmosphere while the other vents accumulated carbon dioxide into space. Eventually, the collecting chamber becomes saturated with carbon dioxide and the venting chamber has little left to vent. Valves are repositioned at this point to make the old collecting chamber become the new venting chamber and the old venting chamber become the new collecting chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This process of course leaks. Some of the good stuff (nitrogen and oxygen) is vented along with the carbon dioxide. Moreover, the vented carbon dioxide is mostly oxygen. Experiments have been tried that used equipment applicable to Mars that converts that carbon dioxide into methane (which was vented), but those experiments were just that, experiments. (Aside: That these experiments have not become operational and have instead been cancelled says something about the prospects sending humans to Mars.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Space Station is a leaky vessel. In addition to those expected leaks from hydrogen and carbon dioxide venting, the station leaks fluids with every docking and undocking, and it also leaks at every joint. This latter problem is is becoming more severe as the station ages. Because of this, the Space Station is regularly resupplied with water, nitrogen, and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2752" LastActivityDate="2016-08-06T18:17:24.793" CommentCount="2" />

So hovering is out. Coming down gently is out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus they perform their 'hover slam' (They should trademark that!).

They have not had a failure of a payload in over a decade and over a hundred launches. Thus for unique and expensive payloads, the suggest that the extra cost is worth it for the record of success in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For very large payloads, the Delta 4 Heavy and Atlas 5 551 are the heaviest launchers, and more powerful than a Falcon 9 1.2. This will remain true until the Falcon Heavy becomes operational and has a few flights under its belt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The upper stage of a Falcon 9 is its weakest feature. It has a high thrust engine (almost 200,000 lbs of thrust), but not the greatest Isp (311s). Whereas ULA uses the Centaur upper stage on both Delta and Atlas launch vehicles. That uses one or two RL-10 engines, which while much lower thrust (25,000 lbs) has MUCH better Isp (450-465s) which makes a huge difference in an upper stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondarily the Falcon 9 upper stage cannot coast long periods and relight but a Centaur can. Thus GTO missions (Geo Sync Transfer orbit) where the payload does the extra work to get to GEO are possible, but Falcon cannot directly insert into GEO since it cannot coast and do the final burn the many hours later that is required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People in the forums have run the numbers for a Falcon 9 with a more Centaur like upper stage and it gets much larger payload numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For interplanetary missions, the Isp difference matters a great deal in terms of what can be lofted to various destinations. (Not getting into a discussion of C3 here). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ULA has played these two cards heavily in the past.  For GPS III launches they did not even compete, since GPS III was basically an assembly line payload, and if one was lost, just build another one out of the insurance money.  Based on price alone they had no chance so they did not bid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that SpaceX has a history of 26 or more launches (Depending on when you read this) with only one well understood failure the reliability argument is going away. Some would argue that the re-usability and recover of the first stage will make them more reliable. That is, they have now seen what a stage looks like AFTER it launches and returns. This can only help refine the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For special one off NRO missions, or maybe the James Webb Telescope, the reliability argument can be a powerful one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has tweeted that he would love to redesign the upper stage of the Falcon 9 but needs to focus on Mars first.

Much in the same way that Curiosity's robotic arm can collect samples and transport them to the &quot;laboratory&quot; inside Curiosity, mini-rovers may be able climb up on to, &lt;strong&gt;as well as down into&lt;/strong&gt; hard-to-reach places for measurements, imagery, mapping (via telemetry or data transfer upon return) as well as some kinds of sample collection. While drilling requires force and Curiosity uses mass and leverage, a clever robot could find leverage between rocks or walls, possibly even moving rocks around to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These guys look like they are ready to go anywhere in the solar system! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;iframe width=&quot;640px&quot; height=&quot;395px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6b4ZZQkcNEo?start=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;above:&lt;/strong&gt; Boston Dynamic's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_sandflea.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sand Flea&lt;/a&gt; launching itself all over the place!

Needs robust electronics and sensors to avoid getting a headache, but possibly fine for sample collection and scouting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently it uses stored compressed gas for multiple jumps (see below). Some interesting ideas could be imagined to make the gas rechargeable from an atmosphere, or replaced with an electromagnetic linear motor (tiny captive rail-gun-like thing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following is from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostondynamics.com/img/SandFlea%20Datasheet%20v1_0.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sand Flea Datasheet&lt;/a&gt; (remember, the specs are for Earth surface gravity!):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;SandFlea is a small robot with remarkable mobility.

If you polled ISS astronauts past and present - basically anyone who's had to think long and hard about the immediacy of technologies effect on life, I'd say the would be mostly thumbs down for keeping an &quot;extra&quot; poisonous gas and explosive gas around &quot;just in case it might come in handy some day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HYDROGEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep a usefully large amount of hydrogen, you'd have to liquefy it.

LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has to be really really cold to store it without a high pressure (= dangerous and heavy) tank, around 20&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You do have 35-45 minutes of relatively good exposure to the cold of space on every orbit. All you'd have to do is invent a new kind of passive refrigerator technology that could take advantage of it using some kind of door that opens and closes, then insulate it from the rest of the station and for the almost 1.5 kilowatts of sunlight per square meter the other 45 minutes of each orbit, then fix it every time it breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping hydrogen around for a long time has issues with making various metals brittle and can lead to failures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_safety&quot;&gt;Hydrogen Safety&lt;/a&gt;, hydrogen can be &lt;strong&gt;explosive&lt;/strong&gt; and concentrations of as little as 4% to as much as 75% in air are flammable. A tiny, low energy spark from a static discharge can ignite it - it's about ten times less energy required than for an explosive mixture of gasoline and air. Hydrogen flames are nearly invisible to humans (there is UV so there are hydrogen flame detectors based on that).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are arguments against the storage of hydrogen for use as a propellant in &lt;a href=&quot;http://space.stackexchange.com/q/17534/12102&quot;&gt;answers to this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen can diffuse through many materials and attack some of them as well. Elon Musk says it is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_e7rA4fBAo&quot;&gt;pernicious&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (10:20 to 12:40 for the entire discussion on hydrogen powered cars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for regular burns to maintain ISS altitude would require somehow adding a new set of engines to the ISS , or transferring the hydrogen (and LOX from somewhere) to a docked spacecraft which could be refueled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of LOX - there isn't any on the ISS. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://space.stackexchange.com/a/17677/12102&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; it is explained that oxygen is brought to the ISS in very high pressure gaseous form, and stored as a high pressure gas. To develop significant thrust, it is usually necessary to deliver oxygen and hydrogen in liquid form to get enough mass per second into a small enough reaction volume. So a system to produce and store LOX would also be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARBON DIOXIDE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic, and even if it doesn't kill you right away, the coughing reflex it triggers can make it more difficult to handle a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leak emergency (until you get a breathing apparatus). It can be stored at relatively low pressure and not so cold temperature if reduced to a solid (dry ice), as can be seen in the phase diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to imagine how it would come in handy, unless you are growing so many plants that they are depleting all of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by humans. However, if everyone leaves and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running&quot;&gt;robots taking care of the plants&lt;/a&gt;, a little extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; might be helpful - depending on what the robots are doing with the plants after harvesting them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting - if academic - question; could waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be cooled by exposure to space to form dry ice, then be stored as potential propellant for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket&quot;&gt;VASIMR&lt;/a&gt; or other ion engine for maintaining altitude. While it is a heavy molecule as a gas, it may be a nightmare in an ion engine. I think carbon would be the last thing you want inside a maintenance-free system with lots of high voltages, and it may be hard to ionize, and maintain ionization since you'd probably end up with both positive and negative ions desperately struggling to recombine with each other, and half of them would end up moving in wrong directions and cause further trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These gases may not have any practical use, especially without new kinds of technologies and more mass.

On hearing those words, the FCO would depress the two&#xA;  buttons in front of him to – as we say – ‘terminate the flight’.  That&#xA;  means exactly what you think it means.  I don’t have to spell it out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog post also explains the role of the shuttle pilot and commander in a 2nd stage range safety scenario, as I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You see, the shuttle Commander and Pilot are designated Agents or&#xA;  Deputies of the Range.  The destruct package is built into the Solid&#xA;  Rocket Boosters and those are jettisoned two minutes into an eight and&#xA;  a half minute powered flight.  After that, should the shuttle go off&#xA;  course toward a populated area, the FCO can do nothing about it.  The&#xA;  responsibility which the President of the United States has given to&#xA;  the FCO cannot be accomplished – except to call the crew and tell them&#xA;  to do what is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So we practice these scenarios – far fetched as they may be – to&#xA;  ensure that the crew knows what to do.  Steer out to sea; shut down&#xA;  the main engines, protect the population along the eastern seaboard. &#xA;  One small problem – that procedure puts the shuttle crew into what is&#xA;  delicately labeled a “black zone”.  If the shuttle is high enough – as&#xA;  it is for much of the boost phase – but with forward velocity&#xA;  significantly below orbital speed – then an unpowered entry will&#xA;  result in the g-loads and heating which builds up too fast, faster&#xA;  than the wings can generate lift.  And the result?  Well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So the Commander and the Pilot are designated Deputies of the Range. &#xA;  If the really bad thing happens, they are sworn to protect the&#xA;  population of the east coast, even at the expense of their crews’&#xA;  lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It takes courage to fly in space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6944" LastEditorUserId="6944" LastEditDate="2016-08-08T22:32:35.097" LastActivityDate="2016-08-08T22:32:35.097" CommentCount="3" />

What we do not know precisely is the source of this radiation. There are plenty possible sources, but none of them is able to describe the full spectrum of cosmic rays. &#xA;I would like to point you to a summary of our knowledge about cosmic rays at &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2015-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf&quot;&gt;http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2015-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the total energy of cosmic rays in our neighborhood is huge. Don't forget that Earth is just a tiny &quot;pale blue dot&quot; in space and the fraction of cosmic rays actually hitting us (and our detectors) is vanishingly small. Secondly, the spatial distribution of cosmic rays is very homogeneous, with  fluctuations on the level of 0.001 only. These two facts make it rather unlikely that cosmic rays are produced by technology of aliens. Required power sources must be extremely huge and we would expect more localized sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, we do observe localized sources for extremely high energy rays only (because they need to come from sources near-by and can not travel too far). However, these high energies are rather unlikely to be used in an engine because they are hard to generate. For comparison: Todays ion thrusters can accelerate Xenon up to 1 keV, 6 orders of magnitude to the left of the diagram above. Using the best known particle acceleration technologies known today (about 100 MeV/m) these extremely high energy rays needed an accelerator with a length comparable to the radius of the solar system (70 AU). Lower energy emissions are much more likely to come from an extraterrestrial space ship, but are also much harder to detect because of the huge background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Further notes on cosmic rays&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also commented about the large error bars near the right end of the plot. This is purely due to statistics, not due to some not understood factors. In this region we expect about 1 particle of this energy per square kilometer and year which makes them very hard to measure. For us it is rather fortunate that these events are rather seldom - they deliver the energy needed to lift an apple by ten meters concentrated in a single atomic nucleus!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The factor of E^2 is used in this plot is to give us convenient units. In many cases this plot is made with a factor of E^2.6, which makes the first part of the plot flat and more easy to see the various kinks and bends in the spectrum. Compare your plot to figure 28.8 in the PDF linked above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These various changes in slope of the curve seem to be caused by solar and galactic magnetic fields which can trap particles to some extend within our galaxy while very high energy particles are reaching us directly from extragalactic sources. The steep drop-off at the end of the spectrum is not unexpected as well: Faster particles start to interact with the cosmic microwave background and are slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The PDF also shows relative numbers for various types of nuclei (figure and table 28.1). E.g. iron is about 1/4000 of the number of protons (hydrogen nuclei). As you can see, the shape of the curve is rather similar for all measured ions. The plot shows this distribution only for relatively low energies because it is hard to distinguish masses at very high energies - the mass of the heaviest nuclei is just 250 GeV, compared to a million GeV kinetic energy. There are also no numbers for really heavy ions beyond iron, because count rates are getting lower and lower and error bars are getting bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12024" LastEditorUserId="12024" LastEditDate="2016-08-09T18:16:40.447" LastActivityDate="2016-08-09T18:16:40.447" CommentCount="6" />

If you are using a rotovator to boost to a lower orbit then the rotovator will be boosted into a higher one and vice versa.  The rotovator then needs to have some sort of propulsion system to move back down to the a lower orbit to be used again.  If the rotovator had an electric propulsion system then it could make the transfer back more efficiently than a spacecraft using a chemical propulsion system.  This is where the potential cost savings come in. A rotovator could deorbit multiple spacecraft for a lower fuel expense if you are willing to wait for it to travel from orbit to orbit which would take a greater amount of time and operator expenses.  In addition to this detaching the tether/spacecraft at the wrong time/position would send the spacecraft and rotovator off into the wrong orbits.  In the case of orbital reentry a seconds delay in detaching could be the difference between a safe reentry and burning up in the atmosphere.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A detailed systems analysis would need to be done to see if it would actually reduce costs.

Higher frequency transponders are more expensive to design and test than low frequency transponders. This is simply because as the wavelength decreases, smaller components within the transponder will have an effect (often unintended). You can build a VHF or UHF radio using a handful of cheap parts. The flip side of this is that higher frequency bands contain more bandwidth, so it is relatively easier to obtain the rights to a large chunk of Ka band than it would be in C or S band.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transponder is often just a fraction of the entire mission, so it's cost is usually insignificant or minor in comparison to other costs.

But that quote does point out that it won't necessarily be completely dessicated like &quot;freeze dried instant coffee&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It points out that there are competing processes. While water near the surface will be under osmotic-type pressure to diffuse &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the surface where it can evaporate while it's still warm, the &quot;big chill&quot; will set in. Once ice, the mobility of the water molecules will be greatly, greatly reduced. It's not solid ice - there are pockets of ice in each cell and the cell walls will be busted up, but there is still a &lt;em&gt;whole lot of cell walls&lt;/em&gt; to traverse, and only water molecules that are on surfaces and aren't &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; ice will have mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How cold will it be?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's try a little physics. Assume we're at 1.5 AU (Mars neighborhood). At earth, the total power is about 1.5 kw/$\text{m}^2$, at Mars $I_{sun}$  would be that times 1.5 $\text{}^{-2}$ or about 670 W. Let's say the cross-sectional area of a space suit intercepting sunlight $A$ is 1.0 m $\text{}^2$ and the total surface area for radiation is 2.5 m $\text{}^2$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The power input from the sun will then be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ P_{in} =  I_{sun} A \alpha$$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $\alpha$ is the absorptivity of the white space suit in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. I'm going to ballpark the diffuse reflectivity at 0.8, and call the absorptivity 1-0.8 = 0.2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Putting in numbers, I get 134 W. Since it's probably going to be spinning, I'll make a simplification and treat this as an equilibrated object. The whole surface area will be at a uniform temperature, and that temperature will be the value that allows it to re-radiate those 134 Watts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stefan-Boltzmann Law&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ P_{out} = A \epsilon \sigma T^4 $$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $\sigma$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_constant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stephan-Boltzmann constant&lt;/a&gt; and is about 5.67E-08 W m${}^{-2}$ ºK ${}^{-4}$, and $\epsilon$ is the dimensionless &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;emissivity&lt;/a&gt; (between 0 and 1). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you might think that a white space suit with a 0.2 absorptivity should also have an emissivity of 0.2, but these things are not constants. They can depend strongly on wavelength. Most things that look white still have an emissivity at longer wavelength infrared (where &quot;cool stuff&quot; radiates) above 0.9. If you go to the linked Wikipedia article for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;emissivity&lt;/a&gt; again, it says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Paint (including white)   0.9&#xA;Paper, roofing or white   0.88 to 0.86&#xA;Snow                      0.8 to 0.9&#xA;Water, pure               0.96&#xA;Concrete, rough           0.91&#xA;Glass, smooth (uncoated)  0.95&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you had infrared eyes (say 15 or 20 micron wavelength) all those things would be pretty much black. None of them would be transparent. Snow is black sand. Water is ink, &quot;transparent glass&quot; is obsidian or black marble, and white paint is black paint. Actually all paint is black paint. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clean bare metal is brilliant, but let it oxidize and it will darken as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, those infrared thermometers - while they do or should have an emissivity setting for accuracy - tend to work without it, because &quot;most stuff&quot; is roughly 0.9 at room temperature, and they often have a default of 0.90 or 0.92 or something like that in the firmware, if you don't specify one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nice unoxidized metal surfaces however are good reflectors at visible wavelengths, through infrared all the way down to radio. Those can be down around 0.1 and below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let's just chose 0.9&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ P_{out} = P_{in} $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ A \epsilon \sigma T^4 = P_{in}  $$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$  T^4 = \frac{P_{in}}{A \epsilon \sigma} $$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plugging the numbers in I get 180 K. That's c-c-c-cold, about -93C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solid ice on the moon, exposed to space (but not sunlight) for millions of years is expected to be stable at 100K (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_water&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lunar water&lt;/a&gt;). While we're not that cold, this is not exposed - it's deeply embedded in a complex biological and crystalline ice matrix, and we may be talking about years or tens of years - faster if David Bowman is in his pod.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The body will probably have a substantial amount of ice. If you bring it in to room temperature it will have some water in it. It will maintain integrity to some degree, which means any bacterial spores (some bacteria have spores) and fungal spores (in other places) may activate, even if only one in every billion bacteria actually survives being frozen in ice, it's going to be a LOT of them. New surface contamination will be present too. It's a race against time between all those competing biological sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not, it won't be a dried out mummy.

A basic spaceport is going to have a lot to maintain.  For example the Kodiak complex has a clean room for final satellite preparations, a vehicle assembly building, as well as a mission control center with communications and computer systems.  Large buildings like these, especially ones with complicated HVAC systems, like clean rooms, and IT infrastructure, like mission control, will require constant maintenance.  Kodiak seems to only launch solid fuel rockets, but other launch sites use cryogenic liquid fuel or oxidizers, requiring extensive tank farms with added maintenance requirements.  On top of that the pads and roadways will require upkeep as well as other general groundskeeper like tasks (cutting the grass or shoveling the snow in Alaska).&#xA;For a small site this could likely be done with a smallish staff likely &amp;lt;50 people onsite full time, this number would go up with a launch bringing in a lot of mission specialists and other personnel.

A big cost is transportation, these launch sites are usually in isolated areas making moving people and materials there expensive.

It is kinda &lt;em&gt;chicken or the egg&lt;/em&gt; problem. The receiver needs precise time to calculate precise distance and precise distance to synchronize time (to calculate the time difference).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The answer&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the fourth satellite that gives your receiver the precise time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The explanation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you only have distance to satellite A you can be located anywhere on a &lt;strong&gt;sphere&lt;/strong&gt; around A.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you add distance to satellite B, you can be located anywhere in the intersection of spheres around A and B, which is gonna be a &lt;strong&gt;circle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you add distance to satellite C, you can be located in &lt;strong&gt;two points&lt;/strong&gt;, which are the intersection of the circle and sphere around C.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you add distance to satellite D, one of the two points becomes &lt;strong&gt;the point&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is the perfect scenario - you've got 4 precise distances and they perfectly fit into single point. But precise measurement of distances requires synchronized time on your receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what if your receiver's time is not synchronized with satellites? In that case the fourth measurement - the distance to satellite D - will be way off. It won't align with neither of the &lt;strong&gt;two points&lt;/strong&gt;, but it will be notably closer to one of them. Let's call the distance between &lt;strong&gt;the point&lt;/strong&gt; and the sphere around satellite D &lt;strong&gt;the error&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point the receiver solves the problem backwards. We know that if the receiver has precise time and 4 distances it should yield precise position. So by adjusting the unsynchronized time of your receiver and recalculating &lt;strong&gt;the error&lt;/strong&gt; with the adjusted time, &lt;strong&gt;the error&lt;/strong&gt; increases or decreases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of synchronizing time is reduced to the problem of minimizing &lt;strong&gt;the error&lt;/strong&gt; by adjusting local time. Once &lt;strong&gt;the error&lt;/strong&gt; is minimized, the precision of receiver's time is maximized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What's so special about the fourth measurement?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have 4 distances. Pick &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; 3 distances of them and if their spheres overlap, they will create two points where all of them intersect. No matter how imprecise the 3 distances are, as long as their spheres overlap they will form two perfectly defined points. But that does not mean the points relate to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fourth measurement is the one that cannot be loose, in order to the 4 spheres overlap in single point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What's the purpose of the fourth measurement?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory, 3 satellites can give you enough data to reduce your possible location to two points. And one of the points usually will be in absurd distance or moving absurd speed so it could be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the fourth satellite is not required to rule out one of the two points but really to synchronize the time of your receiver. Because without that the two points produced by overlapping only three spheres are not reliable &lt;strong&gt;at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Does the receiver just assume its time is precise enough for the initial measurements?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;when I say that the distances perfectly fit into single point, I actually mean that the time error is minimized and other sources of error are not considered (atmospheric etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;this answers is wrong as @AnthonyX points out &lt;a href=&quot;http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5423/how-does-gps-receiver-synchronize-time-with-gps-satellites/17753#comment46854_17753&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;, but still there is little bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5423/how-does-gps-receiver-synchronize-time-with-gps-satellites/17753#comment46858_17753&quot;&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; (I think) in there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16603" LastEditorUserId="16603" LastEditDate="2016-09-03T10:05:19.260" LastActivityDate="2016-09-03T10:05:19.260" CommentCount="4" />

Is it possible to send a Sedna Sample Return mission? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get an answer, we must look to space missions that have already been launched. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle design:&lt;/strong&gt; The spaceship must contain an orbiter and a lander. The lander will reach the surface of Sedna, will take a sample and will return. It must have enough propellant to land and to return. The orbiter must be used as a communication relay to Earth and must have enough propellant to return to Earth. The orbiter must also have an RTG, strong enough to function up to 100 years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this, we should look at ESA's Rosetta and Philae spacecrafts. Sedna has a low gravity, but probably no atmosphere. So, we need propellant both at landing and at launch, but not in too large an amount. We don't know Sedna's escape velocity, but Pluto's is 1.2, 10 times smaller then Earth's. Philae had 100 kg. Our lander will have probably 250 kg, with all its fuel tanks full of hydrazine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The orbiter will have to survey and map Sedna, then it will deploy the lander, then it will wait, then capture the lander and return home. Rosetta had 1500 to 2000 kg, but New Horizons only 500 kg. We will need the lightest spaceship, to preserve hydrazine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lander can be battery powered. The orbiter will need an RTG. Plutonium used in an RTG has a half lifetime of over 80 years, but the thermocouples don't live that long. Basically, the energy produced by an RTG decreases by half in about 25 years. The mission will take probably 100 years, so energy production will decrease to less then 10%. This means that, without at least 100 kg of plutonium, a sample return mission is impossible. It could be possible to use a backup empty RTG, to reinsert plutonium in it. The probe, with lander and without its fuel, must not weight more then 1000 kg. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vehicle will include a lander, an orbiter, but also a huge amount of fuel needed to decrease ship velocity, and also fuel needed to send the probe back to Earth. We might have to send into space a total of 5000 kg. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch.&lt;/strong&gt; The only way to send into space such a large spaceship is with the use of some of the largest existing rockets. An Atlas V would hardly be enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trajectory.&lt;/strong&gt; Sending the probe directly into solar escape velocity is out of question. We have to use the advantages of Jupiter and possible Saturn flybys. If possible, a Mars or Earth flyby are also useful. This will also result in a longer time to reach Sedna. It will take at best 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sedna Approach Phase.&lt;/strong&gt; The probe will approach Sedna with high speed, probably 15 km/s. At that speed, it is impossible to be captured into orbit. We have to decrease speed somehow. Using conventional chemical engines is out of the question, because of the huge amount of fuel needed. The only solution will be a ion engine. As Dawn have shown us, with 400 kg of xenon, it managed to produce a total thrust close to 10 km/s. So, it is possible, if the RTG produces enough energy, to decrease speed from 15 km/s to 1 km/s in 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Ship.&lt;/strong&gt; One extra mission that can benefit from a Sedna encounter is a fast flyby. We can add a 3rd spacecraft, with its own RTG and suite of science instruments, that will detach from the main ship before slowing down. The bonus ship will continue to move with the same speed and will soon reach the interstellar environment. Its mass can be of 300 kg, not much compared to the 5000 kg already needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sedna Orbit Phase.&lt;/strong&gt; Once in orbit, the probe will first enter a high-altitude orbit, to search for moons and characterize Sedna system. Just as Dawn did at Vesta and later at Ceres, our probe will enter closer orbits, mapping the dwarf planet and in the final phase, looking for a place for the lander. Finally, it will deploy the lander who will have a few days to touchdown, to explore the surface, to drill, to take samples and to return. To return to the orbiter, the lander will need to perform high-accuracy maneuvers. The orbit phase will probably take 5 years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of this phase, the spacecraft will need to detach all unnecessary weight. This might include much of its scientific payload, empty propellant tanks, the lander (except for the tank containing samples) and used RTG. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to make the whole spaceship land on Sedna, without the need of a special lander. However, this will result in more fuel needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return phase.&lt;/strong&gt; Sedna has a low gravity. As shown above, the escape velocity for Pluto is a bit above 1 km/s. For Sedna, it is probably 0.7. The orbital speed is only 1.07 km/s. so, a spaceship will only need a 2 km/s thrust to detach Sedna's surface and to get to a 0 km/s speed relative to the Sun. At that point, solar gravity will do all the work and will take the ship on a trajectory towards the Sun. The resulting orbit will not be a straight line, but something looking more like the path of a long-term comet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the probe approaches, its speed will increase gradually. It will move very slowly up to the orbit of Neptune. To speed-up the process, almost all the remaining xenon should be used by the ion engines to increase speed. If not, it could take 400 years to reach Earth. Nobody wishes to wait that long. So, we must accelerate the ship to at least 10 km/s. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the probe passes the orbit of Neptune, its speed increases fast. At Earth's orbit, the spaceship can move with 30 km/s faster then Earth. It can become impossible to land on Earth with such a huge speed. To slow down, the best option is to use a Jupiter flyby, and possibly other flybys. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth Landing.&lt;/strong&gt; The final phase of the mission is an Earth landing. At that time, after almost 100 years, the RTG will produce only a very small amount of power. Many devices will not be working. Maybe, it will be a good idea to have onboard a small solar panel, to provide the power needed for the final phase of the mission. The spacecraft will conduct its final trajectory correction maneuvers, then it will detach the tank containing samples from Sedna. Only the samples will return, softly landing with the help of a parachute. The spacecraft will enter a solar orbit or will burn in the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; After 100 years of travel and with great costs, the mission will return to Earth a sample from Sedna. Probably there will be samples from the surface, materials drilled from a few meters deep and an atmospheric sample (if Sedna has any). Also, the probe can bring dust samples acquired along the journey. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is one major problem about this mission. On Sedna, many solid rocks can be in fact gasses on Earth. We know from Pluto, that its crust is made almost entirely of substances that on Earth should be gasses or liquids. Rocks brought from Sedna should melt or even evaporate. In the lab, scientists will have big problems analyzing the samples. The long needed time and degradation of the samples, together with high mission costs, are the reasons why a sample return mission to Sedna is unfeasible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S.: No spacecraft has flown for that long and nobody has ever designed complex electronic devices able to operate for 100 years. A mission to Sedna requires that all devices will still be functioning after many years. Also, for the return phase, we must make sure that navigation computers, engines, the RTG and reaction wheels are working well until the end of the mission. A sample return mission will be at high risk because we have not enough time to test all systems and sub-systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are many unknown things. Nobody knows what the mass and gravity of Sedna is. We must design the ship to the highest estimated mass, to make sure we have enough propellant. And, as we don't know the exact mass, there is no way to know how much fuel will remain for the return phase. If we have more fuel available for the return phase, we can get our samples faster, but we will have to re-calculate the return route and Jupiter flyby to decrease speed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, since we don't know the mass, we don't know how to enter orbit. All these not known parameters means that many parts of the mission will have to be calculated fast and only when the ship will get to a certain point. There will not be much time for estimations and backup plans. Powerful computers on Earth should decide what to do within hours. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Communication delay is big, because of distance. There will not be much time for analyzing problems. It can be a very good thing to program the ship to automatically find the best trajectory. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14629" LastEditorUserId="1142" LastEditDate="2016-08-15T00:35:46.660" LastActivityDate="2016-08-15T00:35:46.660" CommentCount="0" />

If choose the radius of the earth $r_e$ to be 6371 km, and calculate a circular orbit ($r = a$) at an altitude $h$ of 171 km so that $a = r_e+h$, I get an orbital speed of about 7805 m/s. If I project that on to a non-rotating Earth 171km below, that's 7601 m/s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 28 degrees latitude, the earth is spinning at about 410 m/s, so assuming we're in a 28 degree inclination plane and still nearby the launch site, the ground speed will be about 7192 m/s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see in the plot that throughout this part of the video, the 2nd stage is well below orbital speed, and thus is sub-orbital. However it's picking up substantial speed and getting much closer. Still you see a rising and falling arc that you might expect of something suborbital, and the decrease in the rate of fall is consistent with that - thus the asymmetric shape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CO4Ov.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CO4Ov.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;above:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Odometer&lt;/a&gt; rollover from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Odometer_rollover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;screendata = &quot;&quot;&quot;05:39   165  3646&#xA;05:45   166  3715&#xA;05:50   167  3790&#xA;05:57   168  3879&#xA;06:05   169  3988&#xA;06:14   170  4124&#xA;06:28   171  4333&#xA;06:45  -171  4623&#xA;06:55  -171  4804&#xA;07:05  -171  4990&#xA;07:12   170  5132&#xA;07:28   169  5466&#xA;07:40   168  5739&#xA;07:50   167  6006 &#xA;08:01   166  6299&#xA;08:13   165  6651&quot;&quot;&quot;&#xA;&#xA;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&#xA;import numpy as np&#xA;&#xA;lines = screendata.split('\n') &#xA;&#xA;time, alt, speed = zip(*[line.split() for line in lines])&#xA;&#xA;time = [ [int(thing) for thing in t.split(':')]&#xA;          for t in time]&#xA;&#xA;time = np.array([ 60*m + s for m, s in time], dtype=float)&#xA;&#xA;alt, speed  = [np.array([int(item) for item in thing], dtype=float)&#xA;               for thing in [alt, speed] ]&#xA;&#xA;alt[alt&amp;lt;0] = np.nan       # those marked with a minus didn't actually change&#xA;&#xA;plt.figure()&#xA;&#xA;plt.subplot(2,1,1)&#xA;&#xA;plt.plot(time, alt)&#xA;plt.plot(time, alt, 'ok')&#xA;&#xA;plt.ylim(min(alt)-1, max(alt)+1)&#xA;plt.title(&quot;altitude (final upon each integer km change in video) vs T+ (sec)&quot;)&#xA;&#xA;plt.subplot(2,1,2)&#xA;&#xA;plt.plot(time, speed)&#xA;plt.plot(time, speed, 'ok')&#xA;&#xA;plt.ylim(min(speed)-1, max(speed)+1)&#xA;plt.title(&quot;speed vs T+ (sec)&quot;)&#xA;&#xA;plt.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12102" LastEditorUserId="12102" LastEditDate="2016-08-15T11:58:12.150" LastActivityDate="2016-08-15T11:58:12.150" CommentCount="1" />

These considerations included illumination conditions at launch, launch pad azimuth, translunar injection geometry, sun elevation angle at the lunar landing site, illumination conditions at Earth splashdown, and the number and location of the lunar landing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The time of a lunar landing was determined by the location of the lunar landing site and by the acceptable range of sun elevation angles. The range of these angles was from 5° to 14° and in a direction from east to west. Under these conditions, visible shadows of craters would aid the crew in recognizing topographical features. When the sun angle approached the descent angle, the mean value of which was 16°, visual resolution would be degraded by a “washout” phenomenon where backward reflectance was high enough to eliminate contrast. Sun angles above the flight path were not as desirable because shadows would not be readily visible unless the sun was significantly outside the descent plane. In addition, higher sun angles (greater than 18°) could be eliminated from consideration by planning the landing one day earlier where the lighting is at least 5°. Because lunar sunlight incidence changed about 0.5° per hour, the sun elevation angle restriction established a 16-hour period, which occurred every 29.5 days, when landing at a given site could be attempted. The number of Earth-launch opportunities for a given lunar month was equal to the number of candidate landing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The time of launch was primarily determined by the allowable variation in launch pad azimuth and by the location of the Moon at spacecraft arrival. The spacecraft had to be launched into an orbital plane that contained the position of the Moon and its antipode at spacecraft arrival. A 34° launch pad azimuth variation afforded a launch period of 4 hours 30 minutes. This period was called the “daily launch window,” the time when the direction of launch was within the required range to intercept the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Two launch windows occurred each day. One was available for a translunar injection out of Earth orbit in the vicinity of the Pacific Ocean, and the other was in the vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean. The injection opportunity over the Pacific Ocean was preferred because it usually permitted a daytime launch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So they basically had one launch opportunity per month. I suspect they chose the earliest possible opportunity that could be achieved safely.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="897" LastActivityDate="2016-08-15T19:04:22.407" CommentCount="1" />

I suppose this depends on the exact circumstances of losing the dome.  The way OP asks the question, it seems that first heat is lost and then the dome goes away.  If the water has already cooled to below the sublimation point before the pressure drop occurs then there's no need for it to boil.  If everything is working fine and then the dome flies away while the ambient temperature is above boiling temperature then clearly it would boil off.  However, if the ambient temperature is below sublimation when the dome is lost I don't think it is clear that the water would boil rather than freeze.  The very act of decompressing would cool the water so we can't simply say that the pressure can drop faster than the water cools because the pressure dropping speeds the cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12310" LastEditorUserId="12310" LastEditDate="2016-08-18T20:49:37.067" LastActivityDate="2016-08-18T20:49:37.067" CommentCount="5" />

After the Phobos trip, there would be a short-surface-stay mission to Mars, described as similar to Apollo 17, in 2039. This still doesn't sound quite like what you're asking about, since you're asking about a station.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that, you have to look at the final mission in the architecture, the long-surface-stay Mars mission. The mission would be for a crew of four, and would start around 2040. Like the Phobos mission, there would be about 300 days on the surface starting in 2043. The mission would require 10 SLS launches. Here is an image depicting the stages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BxpI8.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BxpI8.png&quot; alt=&quot;JPL Long Duration Mars mission plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Each lander would be delivered in a manner almost identical&#xA;  to the crewed lander, with the exception that they could&#xA;  use direct entry and avoid aerocapture as an intermediate step.&#xA;  The crewed segments of the mission would be identical to the&#xA;  previous short-surface-stay mission, except that the full crew&#xA;  would go to the surface. This launch campaign would be implemented&#xA;  with a steady cadence of one SLS launch every 6&#xA;  months. The exception is that once every 2 years, two SLS&#xA;  launches would need to occur within one month of each other.&#xA;  Additional ground infrastructure at the Kennedy Space Center&#xA;  would be required to support those biennial extra launches, and&#xA;  that capability would be needed by about 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the SLS and the Orion, which are still in development, the mission would also need at least four additional vehicle types that are either planned or still under study: the planned Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tug; and the Deep Space Habitat (DSH), In-Space Chemical Propulsion stage, and Mars Lander/Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) which are still under study. These are listed for the short duration mission, but are also present on the long duration mission. They do not go into the specifics of the needs for the long duration mission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper also details plans to progress toward a permanent outpost. It says &quot;using this example architecture, a new crew of four could be sent to&#xA;Mars every 4 years along with two cargo landers.&quot; These missions would continue to extend the base on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to consumables, the cargo landers could&#xA;  bring exploration equipment such as pressurized rovers, advanced&#xA;  surface power systems, science equipment, drilling&#xA;  equipment, in situ resource utilization (ISRU) packages, and&#xA;  additional habitation volume. As the Mars base expands, some&#xA;  crew would stay for the minimum cycle time of about 350&#xA;  days, but others could possibly stay for a much longer time&#xA;  and wait for the next Earth return opportunity. In this way, the&#xA;  base could eventually be permanently occupied and evolve&#xA;  toward increasing self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the readiness level of the described technologies, they estimate that this concept should be affordable given the sunset of the ISS in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They conclude:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Annual budget constraints need to be considered as a design&#xA;  requirement for human journey to Mars architectures&#xA;  since it is likely that the NASA budget will not see a dramatic&#xA;  increase beyond adjustments for inflation. This in turn requires&#xA;  a phased approach toward establishing a permanent&#xA;  outpost on Mars to allow the technical risk and the required&#xA;  funding to be spread out and still deliver significant and publicly engaging milestones along the way. One such approach&#xA;  is presented here as an example. It is a minimal architecture&#xA;  that relies on assets already under development or&#xA;  planned by NASA. A series of missions in cislunar space&#xA;  would lead to a Phobos lander in 2033 to be followed in short&#xA;  order by a dress rehearsal landing on the Moon, and then by a&#xA;  crew to the surface of the red planet by 2039.&#xA;  We hope that the ideas and principles introduced here in&#xA;  whole or in part can be a useful input to the process of structuring&#xA;  an implementable human journey to Mars in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasize that at this stage, this is just one example architecture, though the paper notes that other studies have used portions of this as a basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58" LastActivityDate="2016-08-19T13:44:37.130" CommentCount="4" />

Unless an engine is pushing a rocket hard enough, which is called its thrust, it can't overcome the force that is pulling on the rocket, gravity. Also, the bigger the whole rocket is compared to the  the engine, the more thrust is needed to move it. So, engineers talk about the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket, and normally write that T/W. To be enough to move the rocket upward, the T/W needs to be larger than 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NEXT ion engine has a thrust of 236 milliNewtons, and a Newton is the force it takes to accelerate 1 kg by 1 meter per second in 1 second.  Since an ion engine weighs much more than 236 grams, it can't lift even itself into space. The Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters have a thrust of 12 million Newtons each.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why ion engines work so well in space, is that when they are turned on, the spacecraft is already moving in orbit, so it can't fall to the ground any more, and it is out of the atmosphere, so there is no friction slowing it down. In that situation, even though the engine is only thrusting a tiny amount, nothing is overpowering it any more, so it slowly adds up and the space craft accelerates. Because ion engines are extremely efficient with fuel, and it takes years for a deep space probe to go places so there is plenty of time for the acceleration to add up, they are very good for ships that have to go very far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4660" LastEditorUserId="195" LastEditDate="2016-08-20T22:09:55.947" LastActivityDate="2016-08-20T22:09:55.947" CommentCount="0" />

Life forms based on ammonia (rather than water) have been suggested, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane, ethane or propane.[24]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;About 29 chemical elements are thought to play an active positive role in living organisms on Earth.[25] About 95% of this living matter is built upon only six elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. These six elements form the basic building blocks of virtually all life on Earth, whereas most of the remaining elements are found only in trace amounts.[26] The unique characteristics of carbon made it unlikely that any other element could replace carbon, even on another planet, to generate the biochemistry necessary for life. The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. &lt;strong&gt;The great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—to the chemical composition of life on other planets.&lt;/strong&gt;[27]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Life on Earth requires water as its solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and the other elements along with water, may enable the formation of living organisms on other planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.[28] Terrestrial planets such as Earth are formed in a process that allows for the possibility of having compositions similar to Earth's.[29] The combination of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in the chemical form of carbohydrates (e.g. sugar) can be a source of chemical energy on which life depends, and can provide structural elements for life. Plants derive energy through the conversion of light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Life, as currently recognized, requires carbon in both reduced (methane derivatives) and partially oxidized (carbon oxides) states. Nitrogen is needed as a reduced ammonia derivative in all proteins, sulfur as a derivative of hydrogen sulfide in some necessary proteins, and phosphorus oxidized to phosphates in genetic material and in energy transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="897" LastEditorUserId="897" LastEditDate="2016-08-21T16:12:06.330" LastActivityDate="2016-08-21T16:12:06.330" CommentCount="3" />

Please note that this trajectory does not start in LEO, but at ESOI, an orbital height of about 1 million kilometers. Not starting from LEO seems a good idea for a manned low thrust mission - it takes long to escape Earth's gravity well for the main space ship, but passengers could board later using a light conventional rocket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, here is a back-of-the-envelope calculation on how much power is needed, given the assumptions made are correct:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much power does an ion thruster need to get a 300 t spaceship to Mars? Naturally, the electric power can be arbitrarily low, given a very long transfer time. For a manned mission we should aim for a transit time of less than 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A transfer from LEO to LMO (Low Mars Orbit) seems to take about 6-7 km/s on a conventional trajectory. For this question we are going to assume that the same Δv is needed for a low-thrust mission. (Actually, low-thrust missions can not make use of the Oberth effect so that the needed Δv to escape the Earth gravity well is higher than with conventional rockets)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first question is, how much force do we need to accelerate our spaceship by 6 km/s within 2 years? Using the well-known formula $F = m \cdot a $ and $v=a\cdot t$ we get $$F = m \cdot \frac{v}{t}$$&#xA;With $v = 6~\mbox{km/s}$ and $t = 2 \cdot 365 \cdot 86400~\mbox{s}$ we get $F = 28~\mbox{N} $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An ion thruster that could be built today can reach about 50mN/kW force. So we need a thruster with about 600 kW power (scaling linearly, e.g. 1.2 MW for a transfer time of one year).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Earth orbit, sun provides about 1.3 kW per square meter power and a  high-efficiency solar panel can produce about 300 W electrical power from that. This means, the required power could be supplied by a solar array of about 3000 m². But as Mars is further out, intensity of the sun light reaching the panels drops down so that the array size needs to be larger by a factor of 2.3, i.e. 6900 m². Compare this to the ISS solar array size of about 2500 m² (albeit with lower efficiency).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12024" LastEditorUserId="12024" LastEditDate="2016-08-23T21:25:18.683" LastActivityDate="2016-08-23T21:25:18.683" CommentCount="5" />

It is not. You can get to orbital altitude quite easily, and if you do nothing else, once you turn off the engine, you will simply fall back down to the ground. This is because, to take one example, the gravitational attraction of Earth at the altitude of the International Space Station is approximately 90% of that on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather, space (or more accurately in this case, orbit) is when you are &lt;em&gt;going forward very fast&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, you have to go forward so fast that your forward momentum matches the downward momentum imparted by gravity. In order to establish a stable, low (a few hundred kilometers up) orbit around the Earth, you need to move sideways at somewhere in the range 7,000 to 8,000 meters &lt;em&gt;per second&lt;/em&gt;. This is called &lt;em&gt;orbital velocity&lt;/em&gt;, and the value of it becomes lower as you move farther away from the central body (because the gravitational influence of the central body falls off with the square of the distance). If you are having trouble visualizing how fast this is, consider that the ISS, which is in low Earth orbit (about 400 km altitude) circles the Earth once every 90 minutes. The Earth's orbit around the Sun works in the same way, only that the Earth is moving at about 30,000 m/s to make a whole revolution around the Sun in about 365 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So a rocket spends most of its energy to gain that sideways velocity. It obviously spends some energy getting to the correct altitude, because altitude and velocity are intricately linked in the field of study we call &lt;em&gt;orbital mechanics&lt;/em&gt;, but the vast majority is spent gaining forward speed, not altitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An orbit has a value known as its &lt;em&gt;eccentricity&lt;/em&gt;. The eccentricity of an orbit is, very basically, a value indicating how circular it is. A perfectly circular orbit has an eccentricity = 0, and an elliptic orbit has an eccentricity in the range $0 &amp;lt; e &amp;lt; 1$. It is also valid to have $e \ge 1$, but we don't need to consider those cases here (those are &lt;em&gt;escape trajectories&lt;/em&gt; because they are leaving the gravitational field of the central body). Perfectly circular orbits are a largely theoretical construct which mostly doesn't exist in real life; all practical orbits have at least a small, non-zero degree of eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For orbits with very low eccentricity, and where the mass of the object in orbit is far smaller than the mass of the body it is orbiting (such as a spacecraft in circular orbit around the Earth), we can estimate the orbital period $T$ based on $$ v_o \approx \frac{2 \pi a}{T} \Rightarrow v_o T \approx 2 \pi a \Rightarrow T \approx \frac{2 \pi a}{v_o} $$ where $v_o$ is the &lt;em&gt;orbital velocity&lt;/em&gt; and $a$ is what is known as the &lt;em&gt;semi-major axis&lt;/em&gt; (half of the linear distance between the two points farthest apart in the orbit, which for circular orbits becomes the orbit radius). As you can see, there is a close relationship between $T$, $a$ and $v_o$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Earth, if you want to slow down, you can simply stop applying forward thrust. Friction will then eventually (generally quite soon) cause your vehicle to lose forward velocity, and it will eventually come to a stop in one manner or another. This is independent on the construction of your vehicle; it could be a car, a bicycle, an airplane, a helicopter or a race horse, and that doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In space, there is no (or rather, for all intents and purposes and over short periods of time, negligible) friction. Hence, if a spacecraft turns off its engine, the spacecraft will simply continue in the orbit caused by its current velocity and current position within the local gravitational field. Unlike an airplane, the spacecraft can be pointing in literally any direction, and orbital mechanics doesn't care; unlike an aircraft, a spacecraft is not operating within any fluid medium. To turn around, change its direction of travel, or stop, in space, a spacecraft needs to apply &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; thrust in some direction &lt;em&gt;other than the direction of travel&lt;/em&gt;. (There are other ways, such as gravitational slingshots, but those are basically a special case of this, and those don't apply to Earth-orbit launches anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such thrust is commonly, but far from always, applied &lt;em&gt;retrograde&lt;/em&gt;. Retrograde is one of those funny words in rocketry and orbital mechanics; here, it means &quot;opposite to the direction of travel&quot;. In a car, it would be called &quot;in reverse and with wheels pointing straight ahead&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applying thrust partially or fully retrograde has the effect of slowing down the spacecraft's forward speed. Because this means that it can no longer keep up its current orbit, it will start falling in the direction of the prevalent gravitational field, which in the case of a low Earth orbit and thrusting for reentry eventually causes the spacecraft to reenter the Earth's atmosphere as it falls toward the Earth. With less thrust, or by thrusting in a direction other than fully retrograde, it will cause the spacecraft to settle into a different orbit, which may or may not intersect Earth ground or atmosphere. The change of velocity resulting from this thrust is what we call &lt;em&gt;delta-v&lt;/em&gt;, from the Greek letter $\Delta$ which in mathematics is used to indicate difference, and $v$ which by convention is the symbol associated with velocity. The change of velocity needed to settle into a different orbit, even an Earth-intersecting one, is commonly far lower than what was required to establish the original orbit; for example, the Space Shuttle was commonly in an orbit similar to that of the ISS, but only needed &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/12011/415&quot;&gt;approximately 90 m/s of delta-v under power to commit to landing&lt;/a&gt;. Once committed to landing, the space shuttle did not have enough engine power to get back into a stable orbit around the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the engines are fixed in place at one end of the spacecraft and the spacecraft is generally pointing &lt;em&gt;prograde&lt;/em&gt; (in the direction of travel) after the engines have been shut down, the spacecraft has to turn around before it can apply any significant thrust retrograde. &lt;strong&gt;Thus, it has to flip over.&lt;/strong&gt; Because there is so extremely little friction in space, it can do so leisurely, without really affecting its direction of travel much at all; in an atmosphere, the vehicle would probably start tumbling and possibly break up because of aerodynamic forces, and aircraft need special considerations to be able to perform anything resembling similar maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest is merely an elaborate dance to get the spacecraft to settle down slowly and safely in an appropriate spot on the Earth's surface.

A tube design that allows the projectile to essentially pack the air into the end of the tube as it fires could smooth the transition from tube to atmosphere, and at the trajectory you need (roughly 70 degrees from horizontal at tube exit), interaction with meaningful atmosphere will only occur for about 7 seconds.  If the gun is stationary, then the projectile will consistently &quot;land&quot; in roughly the same place in orbit, with slight variation based on air conditions; so only slight course correction would be needed on-board to use the system to put mass on orbit to build and feed a space station complex.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first question is: Can a projectile be designed with meaningful cargo space, self contained launch electronics, an engine system and a tiny bit of fuel for course correction once in orbit, which can withstand 2 seconds of 500 G acceleration, and then 7 seconds of atmospheric flight at orbital speed (starting with air pressure at 5700 M altitude, and getting less stressful from there)?

SpaceX novel approach is to fire three of the nine first-stage engines to &quot;retropropulsively&quot; reenter the atmosphere.  Much control authority is available to the descending stage from the gimbaling rocket engines.  The grid fins are &lt;strong&gt;unneeded&lt;/strong&gt; in this phase of the descent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;high-altitude, high-velocity supersonic descent&lt;/strong&gt; Grid fins operate well in the supersonic flight regime, and are &lt;strong&gt;very useful&lt;/strong&gt; here, as well as the only method the rocket has for control authority at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;transonic&lt;/strong&gt; flight.

The rocket continues to decelerate initially due to atmospheric drag, up until the time that the force of gravity on the descending stage is equal to the force of drag on the stage; at this point, the stage reaches what is called &quot;terminal velocity.&quot;  The grid fins are useful during all of this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;landing burn firing&lt;/strong&gt;: grid fin value quickly falls as the velocity rapidly decreases from the several hundred kilometers per hour of terminal velocity to less than a few meters per second.

SpaceX submitted a response to a NASA request for proposals, and SpaceX won the initial competition in 2006. (SpaceX was the top competitor in that competition, and was the first of two companies NASA executed small contracts with; the second company fell out after failing to raise sufficient capital to meet its project plans, and was later replace by Orbital Sciences, now &quot;Orbital ATK&quot;)  SpaceX has continued to achieve a large number of project milestones since, including the first orbital launch of a Falcon 9 in 2010.

But getting back from an ascending rocket to a descending rocket fast enough seems impossible to me, for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A) Remember, that even with a single engine on at lowest thrust level, the rocket would accelerate away from earth. So after the landing abort, all engines have to be turned off. But with a positive velocity (away from earth), the rocket will experience &lt;em&gt;negative g-forces&lt;/em&gt;, accelerating it to earth &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; than gravity alone would! This is because the rocket in free fall has zero g-force, but with air drag, its movement away from earth is decellerated, meaning, that the rocket is accelerated towards earth faster than by gravity alone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Negative g-forces have drastic consequences. Whatever little fuel is left at the bottom of each of the two tanks, now suddenly feels, that &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; have just been reversed, and starts moving towards the new &quot;down&quot;, which is, where the &quot;up&quot; used to be! You can simulate that at home in your kitchen easily: Fill a glass with water (your &quot;fuel&quot;), take the glass in a hand, then push the glas up suddenly (the abort burn), then down again (the phase, where gravity wins). Even though you never turned over the glass, the water spills all over, when you do that fast enough!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the fuel tanks of the rocket are closed, so the fuel will not spill out during the phase of negative G-forces. And the fuel will start flowing back to the bottom, once the rocket has reached its maximum height and starts falling back to earth, because air drag now causes positive G. But will enough &quot;air&quot;-free (more precisely: helium-free) fuel collect at the bottom during the few seconds of free fall?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B) As already written, the rocket might become instable. While going up with engines off, it gets slower and slower, so that it is harder and harder to control by the grid fins. The fuel sloshing in the tanks add to this instability. The thrusters might be able to keep the rocket upright, but I am not sure, if they can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C) During the non-powered phase of flight, the rocket will hardly be able to offset wind drag. Of course, the rocket could already stear in the right direction to counter wind during the abort burn. But in the case of unsteady wind (which on a nominally performing rocket is the most likely problem to require a landing abort in the first place!) the exact required direction might be hard to predict - and the final correction of the wind shift will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16725" LastActivityDate="2016-08-24T12:40:02.420" CommentCount="4" />

(Microcosm, 2001).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The approximate delta-v for a slowly spiralling transfer over many orbits is, as pointed out already by HopDavid, the difference in orbital speeds for a transfer between circular coplanar orbits. This approximation does not apply to a Mars transfer as your 0.00032 m/s^2 acceleration can reach the required delta-v in much less than one orbit. You may however use it as an upper bound and the Hohmann transfer delta-v as a lower bound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to get to Mars with a low-thrust electrical propulsion system, you will need to (1) escape Earth orbit (2) transfer to Mars and (3) capture into Mars orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft will start in whatever orbit the launch vehicle initially injected it, then use either continuous thrust or thrust-coast arcs (coasting near apogee to increase efficiency) to get into a translunar orbit from where escape is possible by gravity assist (cutting about 800m/s off the delta-v requirement). It is possible that the launch vehicle may put you directly in a trans-lunar orbit but something similar to geosynchronous transfer orbit is more likely. Delta-v to trans-lunar orbit in that case should be around 3km/s for continous thrust (3.2 km/s in the slightly lower acceleration example given by Kemble; much more than the 750m/s for high thrust). To solve the problem with your own numbers you would use Lagrange's orbital equations. (Starting on p. 226 of Kemble or p. 63 of Wertz. This post is already getting too long...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After lunar flyby, you will still not have enough hyperbolic excess to reach Mars. That would be about 3km/s for a typical launch window with high-thrust propulsion minus the small hyperbolic excess you have after the lunar flyby. Since the Oberth effect is no longer working in your favour, you will need roughly this amount of delta-v (with high thrust). That amounts to &gt;3 months of thrust in your example but still much less than the semi-period of the transfer orbit. Expect somewhere in the lower half of 3km/s &amp;lt; delta-v &amp;lt; 6km/s to get you from Earth escape to Mars-crossing orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hyperbolic velocities at Mars insertion will be similar to Earth escape but there is no major moon for gravity assist. (It is possible to get a free injection by making use of the Lagrange points. I will neglect this as taking too long.)

There have also been numerous ideas of using a sail with the solar wind from the Sun.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other is to create a true reactionless drive (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alcubierre drive&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_resonant_cavity_thruster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EmDrive&lt;/a&gt;), which has a number of issues (not least of which is how you get around conservation of momentum and things like that).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The fact that &amp;Delta;V goes up with the &lt;em&gt;logarithm&lt;/em&gt; of the mass ratio is what makes the rocket equation so tyrannical.  Every kg of propellant you add has to be accelerated along with the spacecraft, leading to diminishing returns.  That's why we didn't use rockets to slow down the Apollo spacecraft or Shuttle orbiters before re-entry; it just translated into too much mass to launch.   &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12922" LastEditorUserId="12922" LastEditDate="2016-08-26T20:53:07.787" LastActivityDate="2016-08-26T20:53:07.787" CommentCount="0" />

(Since both gravity and radiation pressure obey inverse square law, this is independent of distance from the sun.) It is sometimes given in terms of the characteristic acceleration or characteristic thrust, which is the value at Earth's distance from the sun. The characteristic acceleration due to solar gravity is 0.005 m/s^2. (Edit: I should have written 0.0059 as 0.006. The basic conclusion will remain the same.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The speed that can be achieved is limited by a number of factors. The maximum temperature that the sail can withstand (which limits how closely it can fly by the sun to gain speed) is one limit. Material strength is also an important factor, such a very thin material could easily be torn apart by radiation pressure when pulling against the inertia of a spacecraft near the surface of the sun. Furthermore, dust so near the sun is not that well studied and may pose a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Wolfgang Seboldt &amp;amp; Bernd Dachwald discuss a number of solar sails in &quot;Solar Sails: Propellantless Propulsion for Near- and Medium-Term Deep-Space Missions&quot; (*1) One currently build-able of 400 m^2 at 87 g/m^2, one of 2500 m^2 at 38 g/m^2 likely build-able if existing technology is refined and one of 4900 m^2 at 23 g/m^2 that would require significant research but is considered realistically achievable. (Payload mass not included.) The third could achieve a characteristic thrust of about 40mN, giving a lightness factor of &amp;beta; = a/(0.005 m/s^2 ) = 0.07.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not enough to reach Proxima in any reasonable amount of time unless the sail is accelerated with large lasers. Instead of working it all out, I will show what happens with a lightness factor of 1 (*2), much higher than the craft above even without payload. If the spacecraft is on an orbit around the sun (ideally highly eccentric) and deploys its solar sail approximately at perihelion, we may assume that the sail exactly cancels solar gravity for the entire trip. This means that the spacecraft will escape the solar system with a constant speed equal to whatever its speed at perihelion was. Unless we also use another propulsion system, we must assume that we start from a bound orbit and so this can at most be the surface escape velocity of the sun, 617 542 m/s (*3).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3.991 * 10^16 m)/(6.18 * 10^5 m/s) = 6.46 * 10^10 s, or about 2000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The acceleration period for such a &amp;beta; = 1 craft will consist of the period where it falls in towards the sun, after which it will as already mentioned escape at constant speed. Falling in from Earth would give much less than the mentioned speed; if we assume a Jupiter flyby was used for perihelion lowering then the acceleration time (starting at Jupiter) would be just about a sixth of a Jupiter year, or two years. (Edit: Egg on my face. I wrote half a Jupiter year, when I should have said half an orbit at half of Jupiter's semi-major axis. That makes for 0.5 * 0.5^(3/2) of Jupiter's orbital period.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(*1) Published in &quot;Advanced Propulsion Systems and Technologies Today to 2020&quot; edited by Claudio Bruno &amp;amp; Antonio Accettura, 2008.

If there's somewhere for the electron to go,&#xA;  and if it can increase it's energy level, then it will absorb the&#xA;  light. If not, then the light can't be absorbed and carries straight&#xA;  on. If it is absorbed, the substance looks black. If it isn't, it’s&#xA;  white [because the light is reflected back].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This means that, if you heat something up, if there's [a higher energy&#xA;  level] somewhere for the electrons to go up to, and it’s black, then&#xA;  there's also somewhere for the electron to drop down to again, meaning&#xA;  that the substance will also emit energy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So if something is good at absorbing light then it’s also good at&#xA;  emitting it.

For the other tethers it would be very difficult to get a substantial anchor mass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the elevator is massive enough that a few catches or throws don't destroy its orbit, it can be a momentum exchange broker. Catching payloads from above or dropping payloads to lower orbits will boost momentum. Catching payloads from below or throwing payloads to higher orbits will sap momentum. By balancing momentum boosting actions with momentum sapping maneuvers, the elevator orbit can be preserved without use of propellent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or if momentum does need to be changed with the use of propellent, ion engines such as Hall thrusters are an option. A xenon exhaust velocity of 30 km/s is nearly 10 times as good as chemical propellents. And if elevator catches and throws are separated by weeks or months, there is time for the low thrust ion engines to build up momentum.  Elevators are a way to have you Ion engine ISP and eat Oberth cake too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe orbital elevators are doable and worthwhile.

To get into a Low Earth Orbit, you need to be traveling at about 7.8 km/s. At the equator, the Earth is spinning at 1670 km/hr, or ~0.5 km/s.

Denver is at 39 degrees North, so the rotational velocity there is ~1298 km/hr, or ~0.36 km/s. So to launch from Denver we need to increase our speed by 7.44 km/s. This is a difference of 0.14 km/s, which is a significant saving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we don't actually launch from the Equator, but we try to get as close to it as we can.  All the different countries around the world try to launch as close to the equator as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider is that the Earth is not perfectly spherical.  It has an equatorial bulge formed by its rotation. This means that the radius at the equator is about 26 miles larger than at the poles. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, this results in the equator actually being taller than Mount Everest. Of course, the atmosphere and ocean also bulges out like this, so you are still under the same amount of atmosphere, but it does make it easier to get to space.

We're assuming magical propellant tanks with no mass.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the second burn, we're accelerating the just the dry mass of the spacecraft by 30000 m/s.

Our $\Delta V$ is the same, so our mass ratio is the same, so we need 1.7 * (1000 + 1700) = 4590 additional kilograms of propellant, for a total starting mass of 8290 kg.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that the mass ratios get ugly as your $\Delta V$ goes up.  If you want to accelerate by 0.001 $c$ (300000 m/s), the mass ratio for the Dawn engine jumps up to ~19437; for every kg of mass you want to accelerate, you have to expend over nineteen &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; kg of propellant.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're not going to reach anything near light speed using any reaction drive that has to carry its own propellant.

But what about making sure you're using that line of sight? If your satellite is facing the wrong way then you can put in as much power as you like, your directional antenna won't make a blip on Earth. Pointing accuracy requires either momentum wheels or attitude thrusters, and usually both (thrusters to de-load the wheels after periods of use). Propellant isn't anywhere near as cheap or easy in space, and the pointing accuracy resolution for GEO is much higher than LEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to space - so you're a 2nd world country looking at dragging yourself into the intellectual elite by launching your very own space station. You can examine crystal growth, ant colonies and spring oscillations in 0g - who wouldn't want to! Do you go LEO or GEO. Certainly in LEO you're more greatly affected by the mass concentrations on Earth, but GEO is so much farther away. It's not cheap to get the bulk material needed for a space station to GEO, let alone the tons of food, water, air and springs that astronauts consume on a daily basis. LEO is closer and therefore cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only come up with one type of mission that requires you to operate in either LEO or GEO (there may be more);&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Removal of GEO Debris/Servicing of GEO satellites - replace GEO with LEO, it can work either way. The key thing here is that you are targeting a specific area of space, it's one of your mission requirements. You want to clean up GEO, you can't send a satellite to remove debris from LEO, it would have a negligible effect.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1567" LastActivityDate="2016-09-01T15:15:36.917" CommentCount="4" />

But with the payload in place, RUD during the test fire is hardly a better outcome than RUD during launch.  I would also expect there to be at least some &quot;bad luck&quot; failure modes that occur only rarely, and are difficult to detect before they do occur (meaning that a test fire before launch effectively just doubles the risk of those failure modes).

You don't need 4 GPS satellites for a solution, you need 3.  As stated above, 1 gets you a sphere, 2 a circle, and 3 one or most likely two points on the circle.  One of those points is far in space or inside the Earth.  The GPS receiver uses the mean surface distance of the Earth, the geode, to determine the correct (closer) one.  Whichever is the closest to the geode wins.  More than 3 satellites just allow better reduction of errors for timing and atmospheric issues, system faults, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of time, I'm not 100% sure, but I would imagine that the actual time of day is not of great importance, but just listening to ephemeris data should get sub-second accuracy for that.  To get the receiver to have near-atomic accuracy I believe the system just makes an initial guess based on the data it has (perhaps an average of all the times it has heard from the satellites + a few MS for the mean distance of receivers to sats?  Just speculation there) and then computers the error in the position.  If the clock is fast, the error is big in one direction; slow produces a large error in the opposite direction.  The receiver's clock is continually sped up or slowed down via a type of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) until the error is as close to zero as possible; this continues for the entire time the device is running.  If the clock starts to drift again, the PLL will catch it and push it back on track.  By doing this, the clock is kept to nearly the same accuracy as those on the satellite, and thus accurate enough for navigation purposes or other precision timing purposes (NTP, radio transmission synchronization, etc).  I suspect that's also (at least partly) why you see a larger error when you first turn on a GPS receiver that gets progressively smaller as the clock gets progressively more in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PLL's have been around for a long time and are used everywhere.  A VCXO is commonly used with a PLL to provide a cheap, variable, high frequency source based on the output of a lower speed, high quality fixed oscillator in radios and other communications gear, along with computers and other electronics.  Hence where clock multiplier comes from with computing, a slow speed, fixed XO drives a faster bus via PLL to get your FSB speed, your CPU then using another multiplier and PLL for its own speed.   PLL's also have been used for clock synchronization and recovery for communications for a very long time in communications networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a decent article on it.  It provides an analogy of cars racing around a track, each one under their own control trying to obtain the fastest safe/practical speed.  When a pace car comes out, they all must get in line and follow the car in front of them, without passing.  The pace car drives a fixed speed based on their speedometer.  Each driver behind it tries to keep a similar distance to it or the car in front of them; they speed up to close gaps or slow down to lengthen them.  Thus they all end up nearly evenly spaced and traveling at almost exactly the same speed.  Remove the reference (pace car), and they're all off at random again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16867" LastActivityDate="2016-09-03T03:49:00.453" CommentCount="1" />

Therefore a cut is made directly above the S-IC using a shaped explosive charge. This leaves the interstage attached to the S-II. However, the ring imposes a significant mass penalty on the second stage. So much so that it is a mandatory abort if the interstage doesn't separate. It too is dropped 30 seconds after the first separation. This gives time for the second stage engines to establish smooth acceleration with minimal rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The sequence for separation is as follows: Half a second after shutdown of the first stage, the four ullage motors mounted around the interstage ignite, followed a fifth of a second later by a command to fire the first separation explosive and ignition of the eight retro rockets mounted in the conical fairings near the base of the S-IC. The two sets of rockets firing in opposite directions pull the two sections of the vehicle apart. Physical separation comes soon after and half a second later, the J-2 engines on the S-II stage are started. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So at the time the interstage falls away, the J-2 engines are going full-thrust.
