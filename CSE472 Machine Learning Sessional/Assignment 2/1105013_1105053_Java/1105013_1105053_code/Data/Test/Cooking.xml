Heating the milk to 190F, in the presence of acid, will allow the albumin proteins to also denature.

Thus, the albumin is already denatured and locked up in the curd. The whey left from that cheese process is mostly sugar and vitamin B compounds. There isn't much protein left.

If you remove the solids, well, that's what pretty much exactly what already happened in your jar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So... if you want to make it out of pre-existing mustard, you could try to remove the solids, perhaps by squeezing in cheesecloth. Of course, that's kind of wasteful; you'll end up with a bunch of too-dry mustard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to feel a little less wasteful, you could try making your own mustard-infused vinegar. It's still going to be kind of the same thing - grinding mustard, infusing in vinegar (along with salt, sugar, etc), filtering out solids - but at least it'd be cheaper to start from whole mustard seed than from pre-made mustard. If you go this route, you could probably use any homemade mustard recipe as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1672" LastEditorUserId="1672" LastEditDate="2016-05-13T22:30:55.360" LastActivityDate="2016-05-13T22:30:55.360" CommentCount="0" />

A chicken breast from an 8-weeks old bird is delicious on its own, but pretty useless if you want to make stock. Again, adding extra necks, feet, gizzards if you need more chicken makes sense.

There is a big difference between resting meat, that is letting it cool, and holding meat in a warming oven, which should be avoided. There are many reasons why you should not rest meat: 1. it continues to cook, 2. it can get rubbery, 3. it does nothing for the juices unless you get it cold enough that it will congeal, hardly what you want to do when serving meat, 4. usually the meat will spend considerable amount of time on a plate in front of a diner before it is eaten. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never rest my flank steak or any of my other steaks when serving them at the Hudson River Valley Art Workshops. And those steaks always come out juicy and delicious. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping this in mind, I never, ever rest my fish. Why? Because I want it out to the diner while it is still hot, while it is at its peak. (Pet peeve is when diners wait to eat the food put in front of them until everyone of them is served. Usually at my restaurant, we have tables of no less than 8 to 12 people and this will mean cool food.) If you want juicy fish, or meat, for that matter, cook it right. My fish is always juicy and tender and perfectly cooked, not overcooked from resting. I am careful how I cook any meat but doubly so when cooking fish. I always take it out when it is 5 to 10 degrees cooler than my target temperature. And with delicate fish, I often use a coating or a cooking technique such as en papillote or en croute to protect the fish, which are also coatings of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And don't forget, the slower you cook a piece of meat, the less bunched the protein will be. Cooking meat at high temperatures, makes the protein bunch into a hard &quot;knot&quot;. Slow cooking allows the protein to stay stretched out and tender. Also, with roast, cut against the grain. With fish, do not overly handle the fish. Avoid turning if you can. I hope this helps.

You can set your water bath to 125°, 130°F, place bagged (thin) items in the bath—straight from the fridge—and come back half an hour to an hour later to them gently warmed. Except for delicate fish, that will not decrease quality (you may need to sear some things again, as of course bagging it will lose the &quot;crust&quot;). In fact, if you use sous vide the entire way through (put the raw product in a bag, cook it in the bag, chill and store it in the bag, reheat in the bag, and then only open the bag to serve) you keep the quality for a long time—easily a month if done right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key thing is that it stays in that perfectly air-tight, air-free bag (and that it's been pasteurized, and kept cold to keep microbes at bay).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because what no reheating method can do is fix the &lt;strong&gt;quality loss during storage&lt;/strong&gt;, because your protein wasn't wrapped 100% airtight—with all air excluded—as it sat in the fridge.

With cast iron, a good seasoning reduces sticking; you just have to be careful to maintain it. There's no comparable treatment for a stainless pan (the closest thing is, well, a non-stick coating) and so you are almost inevitably going to get some adhesion, especially when cooking proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not always a bad thing. A pan sauce, for example, requires some degree of sticking so that you can deglaze the pan and utilize the good stuff in the &lt;em&gt;fond&lt;/em&gt;. Many proteins will also &quot;release&quot; once the outer layer is well-seared, and be easier to remove without sticking, assuming you can let them go that long without overcooking as a whole. You must generally take care to use enough fat, and you'll likely have trouble no matter what with delicate fish, eggs, and thinner cuts of meat (keep your non-stick pan around for those). I also recommend finding a decently thick pan with good heft, as a very thin bottom layer won't diffuse the heat of the burner as well and produce hotter/colder spots on the cooking surface; this can cause problems with inconsistent sticking and release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stainless can also develop a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/52255/white-cloudy-areas-on-bottom-of-new-stainless-steel-skiillet?rq=1&quot;&gt;&quot;haze&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom of the pan pretty quickly, which seems to be a mineral buildup of some kind.

Sure, but it'd make a slightly different dish. You could boil the noodles for example, grill or steam the meat/vegetables and then mix it all together with sauce. You could still probably make a good dish this way. You won't get a typical chow mein though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chow mein aside, you could probably take a really good non stick or seasoned pan/wok and simply cook the meat/vegetables with a bit of water/broth. You'd essentially be lightly steaming it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though as an alternate suggestion, I would instead start with looking for dishes that utilised other cooking techniques, boiling, braising, steaming, grilling as examples.

You'd want to cook it hot, but not too hot, and with a little bit of water water, but not too much. If you cook too hot you're wasting energy, since it takes time for the heat to propagate to the center of the meat. If you don't cook hot enough to at least keep everything at 100C, you'll be wasting more energy over time. If you don't have any water, then even with oil, you'll be cooking mostly just from the pan surface instead of all around thanks to the steam, while if you have too much you'll waste energy heating it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So add enough water to fill the pan with steam until it's done cooking, perhaps half a centimeter or so, then heat it as fast as possible to get it completely hot under the lid, then reduce heat but leave it hot enough to stay like that. Might not be perfectly optimal but should be pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand you had ground meat, you can cook it as hot as you want, and probably don't need to add any water since it'll release some.

I think the reason is the breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs are a good binding agent for ingredients that have lots of moisture and fat to release during cooking - as the mix cooks the breadcrumbs soak up the moisture and keep the mix together and retains some of the moisture. Fish and shellfish are pretty lean to begin with, and as they are usually pre-cooked when making fishcakes they will have already lost most of their moisture. If you use breadcrumbs to bind the mix there will not be enough moisture to wet them. You could add a bit of water but then you're going to get a soggy mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest making fishcakes with mashed potato instead of breadcrumbs as a binder. The potatoes are naturally moist and hold things together well. I typically use a 60-40 ratio of fish to potatoes by weight.

When I make this sort of thing I let it cool somewhat and then add pasta water in small amounts until I get a slacker sauce, then I refrigerate or freeze it. Once you get the idea of how much extra moisture you need you can add some of it to the sauce to begin with, but reserve a bit for after cooking as changes in pasta types and how done it is makes a difference in how much the pasta will soak up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also had some success in rehydrating too thick mac and cheese by reheating it partially mixing some water or milk in, letting it sit a couple of minutes, then reheating the rest of the way slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19707" LastEditorUserId="19707" LastEditDate="2016-05-23T10:31:29.453" LastActivityDate="2016-05-23T10:31:29.453" CommentCount="5" />

The mill will during that time buy the amount of grain they need for one year - from harvest to harvest. The grain gets sorted, tested, dried and cleaned if necessary, and is then put into storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the year, it gets milled. The two factors here are &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt;. A mill works year-round, it makes no sense to let the machines stand idle for a long time. So there is a maximum capacity they can process per year - and a good management won't buy more. Also, there are times of higher demand (think holiday baking) which need more flour to be milled in advance. The grain should rest for a few weeks after harvest for better quality. I'm no scientist, but I trust my miller on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good mill will strive to sell the flour as soon as possible after it is milled, partly for economic, but mostly for quality reasons. While especially white flour won't spoil for months (recommended: one year), darker or especially whole grain flours get rancid quickly and quality decreases. (E.g. changes in taste and moisture content and enzymatic degradation which influence the baking process and results.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The whole grains on the other hand can easily be stored for well over a year, multiple years in fact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big industrial mills work in a similar way, just on a way larger scale and the flour has a longer time from mill via stores to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28879" LastEditorUserId="28879" LastEditDate="2016-05-25T21:29:17.730" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T21:29:17.730" CommentCount="2" />

You can cut it once lengthwise, or 6-8 times crosswise. I usually do the latter because it's easy to mess up the lengthwise cut and end up with one thick piece and one thin piece. If you just try to fry the entire thing, it takes too long for the center to be fully cooked, and most of it ends up dry. Cutting it greatly reduces the cooktime and also improves the quality of your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Baking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heat oven to 400 F / 204 C. Wrap the breast in aluminum foil, with seasonings and anything else you want to bake alongside it (e.g. peppers, onions, lentils). Bake for 25-30 minutes if it's thawed, 40-45 minutes if frozen (please make sure to measure the internal temperature yourself before eating!). You should adjust times based on how you prefer your chicken. If you don't want to keep track of the preheating you can put it in and wait 50 minutes (once again, measure internal temp, I don't want you to get sick).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually just bake it frozen, because it's so easy to take a frozen pre-wrapped breast out of the freezer, open it, wrap it, and toss it an into the unheated oven.

The heating element is controlled by the thermal measurement unit.  A more powerful element would still turn off once the set temperature at the measurement unit is reached.  The difference would be how fast it reaches the temperature and more hot spots closer to the element.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the &quot;variable&quot; options you can alter the voltage or the current running to the heater. One issue to be aware of is that you would need to keep the power supply to the smoker's control board separated and unaltered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altering the voltage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a power supply called a variac or variable transformer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wJMH8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wJMH8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adjust-A-Volt variac&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since this plugs into the a home receptacle and has a standard receptacle coming out of it, it would be safer from a wire splicing perspective.  Keep in mind, you'd need to acquire a variac that can the wattage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will look and feel like a cold war submarine commander when adjusting the voltage on this kind of equipment so this is a high testosterone solution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There's conversational value here for parties.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A potentially fiery death.  Playing with high wattage hacks requires strict attention to detail and close supervision of the device.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cost.  The price ranges for these seem to be $180-$400ish in the 2000W range.  This could significantly increase the overall cost of your smoker setup.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control board of the smoker can certainly cope with some range of voltage under the usual 120V, but it may not operate at the lower voltage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after everything is working you probably don't want to invite your fire insurance provider over for dinner if you like your current insurance rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altering the current (by adding resistance):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can add a variable resistor.

These higher power devices require alloys that are expensive to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The variac would be my preferred cooler and safer solution out of the two, but keep in mind that the smoker control board wants plain old 120 line voltage.  It will not operate very far out of the 120 volt range and, even worse, could malfunction and not turn off the element.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of any solution,If you do proceed you will be hacking a 1000+ Watt device please be very careful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46048" LastActivityDate="2016-05-27T19:16:11.200" CommentCount="0" />

The FDA rules will keep you safe, but they are written to keep you safe under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, after cooking there were zero bacteria in this stock or on the stockpot.  There were zero botulism spores in the stock or stockpot.  Pressure cooking on high for an hour has completely eradicated everything.

All told though, this is clearly going to be a tiny amount of air overall.

Fill it with lukewarm water, then put it on warm, for instance, and check every hour for the temp.  If its lowest setting gets higher than 140F (60C) in less than two hours, it's completely safe.  On warm, mine is about 180F (about 80C), so it's fine.  Low and high bring it up over 200F (about 95C), the only difference in the settings is how quickly this happens.  Last but not least, for the most safety, I would briefly microwave/ bake/ saute any new solids going into the pot over time, and bring any new liquids to a simmer (microwave's fine), so that they don't drop the temperature of the crock pot.  If it's a big piece of meat, just get it to room temperature (thaw in the fridge first if frozen, then half an hour on the counter), and sear the outside well before adding it.  I actually have an &quot;endless soup&quot; going now, because of some issues with my fridge.  I don't like and can't afford waste, but also can't safely store leftovers right now, so I decided to keep things hot in my crock instead.  I made an initial pot of soup, and then we ate most of the solid bits with a little of the broth.  I added some more water and let the little bit of leftovers sit hot overnight.  The next day, I put in new meat and veggies at the time I would have put it in, if I were making a fresh crock pot meal.  I also add more/ new herbs, because the scent of the herbs breaks down after being held hot for a long time.  The older items do turn into a sort of mush, but they make a very rich base for your new items, which won't be overdone if you do it this way.  I actually like it so much that I may keep doing this, even after the fridge is fixed!  lol  That said, I personally will change my &quot;endless&quot; pot after three meals.  After all, it could end up tasting quite same-y after a while.  When you work in food service, the rule is generally not to keep prepared items for longer than three days under refrigeration.  Obviously, we keep things for longer in our refrigerators at home, but it's a good general rule of thumb if you're concerned about safety.  And, discarding a little leftovers every third day is better than discarding leftovers every day, or leaving them to while away in your fridge, be forgotten, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To the guy with the crappy crock pot:&#xA;New crock pots are not the issue.  You got a cheap crock that's probably made in China, or some other place where they don't care.  Get something better.  I have a newer crock pot from around 2014, and it has never given me any off flavors.  This is not a new/ old issue.  This is a good ceramic vs bad ceramic issue.  My crock pot was about $40.  You don't have to break the bank, just don't get a skeezy off-brand cheap-as-dirt model.  Get a crock from a reliable brand name.  Mine is a Hamilton Beach.  It's not the best pot ever, the rubber seal actually takes some heat damage if it's run on the high setting for too long, but said damage is superficial, not functional.  Rarely sticks, can be cleaned with an SOS pad without taking any damage at all to the finish, and not a single off flavor.  I actually bought this new pot because an OLD crock pot was given to me, and I was tired of that weird taste you're describing.

The jars typically used aren't magic, they're just something that can take those temperatures and reliably produce a good seal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if hypothetically you have a vacuum bag that you know can survive the pressure canning temperatures with the seal completely intact, it would work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it seems difficult to find out if vacuum bag materials can actually do that. As far as I can tell, vacuum bag manufacturers don't generally publish upper temperature limits. I would be concerned about the heat seal degrading, the bag weakening and possibly bursting, and so on. I suppose you could try it and see, since it should be fairly obvious if a vacuum bag is no longer airtight. (I'm assuming the plastic is heat safe in terms of food contact to those temperatures, since it's apparently safe to make the heat seal in the first place.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And for emphasis: you really do need a trusted recipe.

Large eggs are about 2 ounces each, which makes custards easy&#xA;  to manage without a recipe: a cup of milk and 2 eggs, or ½ cup of milk&#xA;  and 1 egg. But 1 large egg will set three-quarters of a cup of milk&#xA;  into a perfect custard. So, as with all ratios, and recipes, it can&#xA;  vary. If you intend to turn the custard out and it needs to hold its&#xA;  shape, stick with the basic ratio. Extra yolks are often added for&#xA;  texture and richness. The quantity of sugar and the quantity of fat&#xA;  also affect the final outcome. If you’re using a lot of sugar, you may&#xA;  need to add a little more protein for structure.

Pure ice cream can be relatively elastic when frozen just by having lots of sugar, fat, and egg yolks in it.

These are more effective emulsifiers/stabilizers than eggs and work at a higher temperature than eggs do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many stabilizers are natural products, Xanthan gum is the product of bacterial formation and Guar gum is processed bean paste, so I personally have no problem with them and use them in my ice cream sometimes to improve the texture.

This has to be done to keep the balance between pectin, starch and simple sugars. Potato cells are held together by pectin (a form of sugar) and contain starch granules. When the cells come in contact with heat and water, pectin starts to decompose into simple sugars, which exposes the starch granules, which in turn release the starch they contain. Too much sugars and the fries become to brown, to less starch and your fries won't have a decent crust, and so on. Therefore balance is important. Now, putting the fries into hot water serves two purposes: rinse off excess sugars and activate an enzyme that strengthens the pectin, giving the fries a former and more intact structure. Problem is, this enzyme woks better the higher the water temperature, but stops working altogether above ~170 degrees Fahrenheit. But here comes the vinegar: acid slows the breakdown of pectin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step two is deep-frying the fries in 360 degrees Fahrenheit vegetable oil for 50 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step three: freezing the fries overnight or longer. This helps make the interior of the fries all the more fluffier. By freezing all the excess water inside the potatoes gets converted into ice crystals which damage the cells inside the fries and make it easier to then become expelled as steam in the last frying step which is...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step four: deep-fry the French fries in 360 degrees Fahrenheit vegetable oil for 3 1/2 minutes, drain them, season them and serve them immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40679" LastEditorUserId="40679" LastEditDate="2016-06-07T00:07:24.477" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T00:07:24.477" CommentCount="5" />

Or is it actually stronger because of that and is used at breakfast to give a good kick?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37146" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T12:35:03.897" Title="English Breakfast vs Ceylon tea" Tags="&lt;tea&gt;&lt;caffeine&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="2" />

A simple way to put it is that variety doesn't mean much, one assam may have much more caffeine than another, so saying a tea is a blend of assam and ceylon doesn't mean it has more or less caffeine than pure assam.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flavor: A stronger flavored drink provides more stimulation to the brain than a weaker flavored drink. The more something attacks your taste buds the more wake-up power it has. Orange juice has no caffeine but it still has eye-opening properties for most people&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;English breakfast teas are blends of strong-flavored tea varieties like Assam and Kenyon, they are designed to be drank with milk and maybe sugar. Ceylon is actually a lighter flavored tea, usually used in afternoon blends for a lighter taste, although it can be used in english breakfast tea. Caffeine-wise they vary but strength of flavor does not imply caffeine content if the quantity of tea used is the same. If you get a stronger tea by adding more leaves to the brew then you get more caffeine of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So english breakfast tea is a good eye-opener as much from its strong flavor as its caffeine content. Ceylon is less strongly flavored but probably similar caffeine content per weight of tea, so would be less of an eye-opener. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19707" LastEditorUserId="19707" LastEditDate="2016-06-08T12:35:03.897" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T12:35:03.897" CommentCount="1" />

Usually this is on the bottom, but can also be on the top, if you are using a dutch oven. I do most of the cake making I do in a dutch oven, its the most practical way I've found. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To prevent burning as Joe pointed out you need to do 1 of two things: stop the cake being in contact with the bottom of the oven, or put something between the bottom and the cake mixture. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe suggested putting another pan in the oven, but finding a pan that fits is tricky and only provides a small amount of insulation. A better and more flexible approach is to use balls of tin foil and then just place a normal cake tin on the top. The tin foil is good at preventing the heat from transferring from the bottom of the oven and can be made bigger or smaller depending on the size of the tin, and they will always fit!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other solution is to protect the bottom with fruit. This works well as well, and can sometimes give a better result, but also can require a bit more heat control. Using something which completely covers the bottom is better, with grated apple mixed with cinnamon and sugar working particularly well. Its moisture protects the cake well, and even it its quite hot on the bottom, you can end up with a sort of 'tarte tatin' finish on the bottom (or top when its turned out). Other large fruits work well, like halved plums or such.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I've found useful is to be able to control the distance from the fire. I have a tripod I use for this and this allows you to keep the bottom of the cake a reasonable distance from the fire and prevents the bottom burning. Putting some of the first (a couple of small smouldering logs) on the top of the dutch oven is also really useful to keep the oven hot without having too much heat from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can't control the distance from the fire, then its better to wait until the fire has died right down and then place the dutch oven on the spread out embers (or on some bricks holding it above the embers) and then place some of the fire on the top. It's better to have heat from the top than have too much heat from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="210" LastActivityDate="2016-06-09T13:53:35.933" CommentCount="2" />

Clabber Girl's reaction is approximately 40% with moisture and the rest when heat is applied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Rumford and Clabber Girl aren't chemically the same.  My first question is,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Can anyone say what the chemical difference between the two is?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand that a double-acting baking powder has a base, two acids, and filler.  The base will react with one of the acids at low temperature, creating carbon dioxide bubbles when I mix my batter.  It reacts with the other acid at high temperature, creating carbon dioxide bubbles when my batter is in the oven.  What I think the above FAQ is saying is that Rumford has a 70/30 split between acids that react at low temperatures and high temperatures, while Clabber Girl has a 40/60 split.  But I don't know what chemicals the two baking powders are formulated with, and I don't know how the split between the two acids is being measured (volume? weight?), so I don't know how much carbon dioxide they generate during each reaction.  That leads me to my second question,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a practical difference between different brands of baking powder, or are they all formulated so that they function the same?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be the case that the two baking powders are formulated so that Rumford and Clabber Girl release carbon dioxide in the same proportions in their first and second reactions.  This seems possible to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's another possible way in which two baking powders could differ.  Most recipes specify volumes (like &quot;1 tsp&quot;).  They assume it doesn't matter whether you're using Rumford or Clabber Girl or anything else.  But even if two baking powders release carbon dioxide in the same proportions in the two reactions, they may not release the same total amount of carbon dioxide.  A teaspoon of one might release more carbon dioxide than a teaspoon of the other.  A manufacturer can control how much carbon dioxide gets released per unit volume by adding filler, which leads me to my third question,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is one of the purposes of filler to make sure that the amount of carbon dioxide per unit of baking powder is the same between different brands of baking powder?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="47280" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T10:31:07.803" Title="Chemistry of different brands of baking powder" Tags="&lt;baking&gt;&lt;baking-powder&gt;&lt;leavening&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="2" />

Added water is the next ingredient, and most certainly comprises 45% or more of the product.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the label, lets do some calculating.  From the label, each 56-gram portion has approximately 3/4 gram of salt ... salt water is 'injected' (likely vacuum aspirated) into the chicken during processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This leaves 55.25 grams for the serving.

Calories from carbohydrates equals 48 (12 * 4). , subtotal 76). Running calorie subtotal: 74.

When used by the bacteria it converts into lactic acid and other organic acids and metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation causes a significant reduction in lactose. Commercial yogurt may contain more sugars than milk because they are added to it after the fermentation has been completed. A&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example a cup of milk usually contains 11-13 g of lactose. A cup of home made yogurt will have up to 4 g per cup depending on how long the fermentation process is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other nutrients will not change much. I think the easiest way to calculate nutrition is to keep fat and protein at the same level as milk (if you are using powder milk as well as regular milk, take that into account) and reduce the sugars by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I make yogurt, I start with 1 liter of whole milk and I add three tablespoons of dry milk and one cup of yogurt from a previous batch. I end up with 7 @ 7 FlOz jars after the process. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the milk nutrition one liter of milk was providing about 600 calories with 44 g of sugars, 32 g of fat and same 32 g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The milk powder (3 Tablespoons) were providing about 65 calories, 10 g of sugars, 7 g of protein and no fat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I add a whole 7 FlOz yogurt to make 7 new yogurts, pretty much the milk and milk powder will make 7 FlOz yogurts. So each yogurt will have 1/6 of the calories, protein and fat that the fresh milk and powder milk contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding sugars they will be probably one third of the original amount as the other 2/3 will be converted into lactic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lactic acid also contributes calories, so the total amount of calories does not vary much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, finally!!!! what is the nutritional value for my home made yogurt (per 7 FlOz). 110 calories, about 3 g of sugars, 5.34 g of fat and 6.5 g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.

When meat is cooked and the cells expel moisture, there are a lot of dissolved proteins which sometimes make the liquid light-colored and thick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People tend to notice it more with certain meats than others.  With bacon, it tends to show up a little more because a lot of commercial bacon is now wet-cured by injection.  The extra moisture in the bacon flows out quicker during cooking and carries protein with it.  This is also more of a problem with thinner cuts of bacon, since the more &quot;damaged&quot; cells, the more this protein leaks out.  Thinner cut bacon -- like the ground beef mentioned in the link above -- has a higher ratio of cut and damaged cells than thick-cut bacon.  (There are other factors that can add to this too, e.g., freezing, which also damages cells.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's safe to eat, though not particularly pleasant textured or tasty.

But, like you, I sometimes end up with an excess of egg whites after baking or cooking something with a lot of yolks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slow cooking -- and most importantly, not overcooking -- seems to be a bigger issue than with whole eggs.  Otherwise, they end up tough.  I haven't tried it myself, but I've read that some people poach them instead (a &quot;poach scramble&quot;) just to keep them tender and not overcooked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you want to fry them as &quot;normal&quot; scrambled eggs, the only thing you can really do to improve them is add something else.  Here are a few things I've tried that might help:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mix in a whole egg per 1 to 3 egg whites.  It's not as rich or flavorful as all whole eggs, but it's more tolerable and has more of the standard &quot;eggy&quot; flavor.  I don't find a 1:1 mixture to be that bad at all.  Obviously the more you dilute it, the less it's like whole eggs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add a dash or two of heavy cream (or other relatively rich dairy).  It will add back a little tenderness and richness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add more butter than you'd usually use for whole scrambled eggs.  Same effect as above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If there are any herbs, vegetables, meats, cheese, or other ingredients you like in scrambled eggs or omelets, try adding some.
