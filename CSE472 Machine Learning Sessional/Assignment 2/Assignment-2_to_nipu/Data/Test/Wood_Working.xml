The construction details of a piece can be perfectly good and it can still warp or distort if the wood isn't quite up to snuff (e.g. it wasn't dry enough before being used) or perhaps if the factory was drier than where the table ended up, so some expansion took place in every piece of wood used which the design can't accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit after update:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those pics help a bit in understanding what's going on, although it's hard to visualise the entire piece the way you would if you could look at it in the flesh.

To accomplish your design you will need a saw, drill, chisels and wood glue. The tenons on the vertical studs are simply cut with a saw. Mark the depth of the tenon around the four sides of the tenon first and cut them to the depth of the wast to remove and mark the extent of the tenon on the top and down the sides of the stud  and cut down on the outside of the line on all four sides.  Next mark the location of the through mortises on the top  plate and use a drill to remove the majority of the waste being careful to stay on the inside of the perimeter lines. Next use a chisel to clean out the mortise walls neat, again staying inside the lines.  Finally clean up the edges of both the mortise and tenons so that they slide together snugly.  I would use a waterproof glue to secure them together if the assembly will be outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While drawing I realized the first stud can't go on the edge so that would take some thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This situation will also work, but instead of a square tenon, extend the mortise to the end of the top palate and modify the tenon accordingly.  A good glue job will hold the final stud in place just as well as if it were in a fully enclosed mortise.

The traditional timber frame uses various well-cut joints that intersect nearly perfectly, then often locked in place with pegs, and originally a house's roof frame would have featured some similar joints (derived as they were from trad timber framing practices). But today there's almost no actual joinery and we largely rely on metal hanging brackets, nails, screws and bolts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it could be argued that the old way was better, producing stronger buildings that hold up better over time, but even if we accept that as a given there's no denying that the modern way produces structures that are &lt;em&gt;strong enough&lt;/em&gt;. And they can be made significantly stronger than the norm by just exceeding code (e.g. using more numerous and/or longer fasteners, screws instead of nails in certain places, using every hole formed in a joist fastener and not just the minimum required by the regs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my advice would be to go ahead with this sort of construction** only if you want to do it as an exercise in laying out and cutting of joints, for the pride in knowing how the shed was put together when you're done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if your primary goal here is merely to end up with a solid shed then be confident that modern metal fittings, galvanised nails or screws will produce a structure that's good enough, both in terms of strength and longevity. My parents' back garden had a shed in it that was taken down recently; it was made of softwood of indifferent quality as most sheds are over here are and was largely put together with staples (yes, staples) and yet it withstood plenty of bad weather, including two or three hurricanes, in the 30+ years it stood without losing its roof, being structurally undermined or even losing a single siding board. It was heavily weathered when it came time to take it down recently, with many loose boards and some rot. But it still had to be cut apart using a reciprocating saw! So build just a bit better than this and your grandchildren will be wondering what to do with the shed grandpa Snyder built way back in 2016 :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*For a bit of historical perspective, I have electronic copies of carpentry books dating from 1875 through to approximately the time of the First World War and looking through them just now &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; show joinery used for stud wall construction that I could find. All the drawings appear to show basic butt-jointed timbers used throughout, presumably to be toenailed in place as is common practice today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;**But not exactly what you've shown. The orientation of the wood in the rail in the Sketchup image doesn't make best use of the strength of the wood. It should be edge-up, not face-up, to best resist bending forces (maximising 'beam strength'). And with this orientation you wouldn't go ahead with your planned M&amp;amp;T joints, a better fit would be half-laps. You could use bridle joints as an option but they're more difficult to cut and probably provide no real improvement in strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T08:48:18.590" CommentCount="4" />

Looking closely at your picture, I can see some faint tan lines through the collet where it is probably clogged with sawdust. If the bit's been left in there for quite a while, humidity will have settled into the sawdust and hardened it quite nicely. Clean out the collet as thoroughly as you can, using dental floss and a small pick if necessary to get the dust out. That should help prevent the new bit from getting stuck. I'd also recommend not keeping a bit in the collet to prevent it from happening again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible, depending on how long the bit's been in there, and what conditions the router has been stored in, that there's a bit of rust binding the two together.

So I highly recommend after sawing that you immediately sticker the wood, with some heavy weights on top, and leave it for a couple of days minimum in your workshop to acclimate. &lt;em&gt;Do not&lt;/em&gt; let it sit flat on a benchtop, you can virtually guarantee problems if you do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T07:43:02.743" CommentCount="0" />

The end-grain. The wood I have available is old(30+ years) and very dry larch-wood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beside the steps one could take, that are already covered in various questions across this and other sites I stumbled upon a method that is called &quot;sizing&quot;. I hope I spelled that right.

He also covers gluing end-grain (starting at ~5:20) and suggests making a &quot;sizing&quot;(at ~6:00), which is basically wood-glue mixed with some water to &quot;size&quot; the wood before the actual glue-up. To me it seems this sizing is just sealing up the end-grain pores with wood-glue. And the mixing with water is done so the thinner substance might penetrate deeper into the wood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My thought now is that I will try to use this technique for the end-grain parts of my table (probably all of them) to close the pores and make it more durable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To achieve that I would put masking tape around the edges of the wood and soak the end-grain with my &quot;sizing&quot;. The masking tape would protect the surface of the wood from ugly glue-stains during the sizing. After all is dried up I would take off about half a millimeter (~1/64&quot;) with the table-saw/miter-saw for a smooth end and start to apply the actual finish everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Question(s):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory I think this method to be quite ingenious and am wondering why I haven't heard of it before.

(Of course that answer will probably be dependent on the density and type of the wood)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes it will depend on the type of wood, not its density but how absorbent it is. Red oak for example is much denser than pine but will absorb liquids &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more deeply into end grain under normal circumstances because of its structure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, size is normally relatively viscous so absorption should be expected to be fairly shallow, on the order of 2mm at best, which is very approximately 1/16&quot;, but possibly as low as the 1/64&quot; that you mention you plan to trim off so I wouldn't do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any anyway I wouldn't suggest you seal the end grain using dilute wood glue. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soaking finish into the end grain is much more commonly done, but a superior alternative is to coat it with epoxy. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockler.com/how-to/achilles-heel-outdoor-furniture-projects/&quot;&gt;How to Weatherproof Outdoor Furniture by Curing It with an Epoxy Coat&lt;/a&gt; on Rockler.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Will this help preventing/delaying rot?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's exactly what this is for. By preventing water penetrating deeply into the wood at the end grain (which is far and away the most absorbent surface on any wood) it will greatly slow deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Will the masking tape prevent the other faces to get ugly glue stains?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes.

It's best to have an epoxy that's quite thin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the epoxy you're using doesn't have the desired flowing consistency its viscosity can be lowered by two main methods: adding solvent or heating. The usual solvents mentioned are an alcohol of some kind, usually denatured alcohol (DA) in North America, or acetone. Note: diluting epoxy does affect its final strength, but for this it shouldn't be a big deal (especially if you don't overdo it, and only a little solvent will be needed to get to the right consistency).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to use heating you can gently heat the separate hardener and resin, or the mixed batch, using a hairdryer or a heat gun. You'll see it immediately makes the epoxy much more fluid. If doing this it's also worth heating the end grain because as it cools it will suck the epoxy deeper into the pores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T15:30:49.600" CommentCount="1" />

Many paints and varnishes will state on the label that brushes should be washed after use and if this advice is followed properly you'll never have a brush dry stiff or hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to beat yourself up about your brush having dried hard, it has happened to almost everyone at least once.... and for some it's a regular occurrence. I've rarely handled brushes other people have cleaned (and this includes numerous commercial painters) and not found them at least slightly stiff! Many have been much worse than this. Brush cleaning is a time-consuming and frankly boring task that comes at the end of the process where folks are already tired and want to just be done with it so it's very common for people to do a half-assed job. I'm guilty of this myself and I bet nearly everyone has been too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you thought you were rinsing the brush well you probably weren't using enough solvent, so in effect dilute varnish was left distributed uniformly through the brush head. The solvent container should be quite large in relation to the size of the brush for effective rinsing, as you want the dilution rate to be high. In practice this means that for a 100mm (4&quot;) brush you should be rinsing in &lt;em&gt;something the size of a small bucket&lt;/em&gt;. Personally I think that even a small finish brush shouldn't be rinsed in less than 500ml of solvent, and going up to a litre wouldn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In my case, I use my paintbrushes for applying varnish, however care for both paint and varnish (if there's any difference) would probably be most useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No effective difference. Although with paint it's much easier to see how successfully we've cleaned a brush since any paint remaining will stain the drying paper/cloth at the penultimate step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The proper traditional method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Rinsing is just one step of a multi-step process in the traditional method, but it's not actually step one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wipe the brush as clean of paint or finish before you rinse. It's counter-productive to contaminate your rinsing solvent with a large volume of finish when you can so easily remove a large amount of it by simply wiping the brush dry beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rinse in solvent. This does not merely mean swishing the brush back and forth in the liquid, you should press the brush out on the bottom or sides of the container to fan the bristles out and help the solvent get between them. Rinse a bit, wipe the brush against the rim, rinse a bit more, wipe. Do this a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry out the brush on paper or cloth (it won't end up dry, you're just soaking out excess).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rinse again as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry the brush as thoroughly as possible on more clean, dry paper towels or cloths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you wash the brush in &lt;em&gt;warm&lt;/em&gt; soapy water, splaying the bristles out in the palm of your hand or against the base of the sink, working up a good lather, and then rinse thoroughly. I can't stress how much difference warm water makes here. You can use cold where and when necessary, but warm water makes the job much much easier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the soap a block of basic hand soap is fine, also dish soap/wash-up liquid or liquid hand cleanser can be used, it doesn't make that much difference with coarse-bristled brushes and makes zero difference with synthetic brushes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat the washing if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've thoroughly washed and rinsed the brush the bristles should be squeaky clean. Re-form the brush head and put it aside to dry. Flat, hanging tip-down or in a jar with the bristles pointing up generally makes no difference any more, but if you want to err on the side of caution hang them or dry flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phew! You're probably tired just reading that, any wonder nobody wants to do this properly on each and every brush used every single time? And it's no joke, cleaning a few brushes really well this way can take the guts of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; when using the brush for solvent-based paint the brush should be absolutely dry before you use it again and overnight drying is often not enough. It's fine to use a slightly damp brush again if using a waterbased finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solvent only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You can clean a brush perfectly well using solvent only. The reason most don't do this is because of the amount of solvent required, and the space the containers take. Re. the note above in the traditional method about the amount of solvent, for this method to work well you'll need at least a couple of litres and again, more would not hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For oil-based varnish I would use &lt;em&gt;at minimum&lt;/em&gt; two rinsing containers, but three or more is better. Some people use as many as five and report that it does make a difference. Personally I doubt if you're doing it right that more than three is necessary, but a fourth could be added for security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wipe the brush dry first.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rinse in container one and dry out the brush as described above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Now do at least two rinse cycles in the second container.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dry again and rinse well in the third container. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dry off the brush and re-form it into shape and put it aside to dry. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time it's okay if the brush is still slightly damp when you go to use it again as it's damp with the right solvent, and you'll probably want to dampen it before use anyway (see related point at bottom below the separator).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To monitor how well you're rinsing out the brush the solvent in the third container should remain clear, without any tinge of yellow, nearly indefinitely (literally years if you're not cleaning brushes on a regular basis). If it does start to become yellowed it is not the end of the world, but it indicates you should be being a little more scrupulous in the preceding steps or that you're not using a sufficient volume of solvent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you conscientiously use either of the above methods well your brushes will last and last — I have numerous brushes that are over ten years old and still going strong.

The primary reason to do this is that it's an aid in smooth brushing, it helps the finish flow out from the brush (and it is excellent at this). A second reason that might be given is that it helps with rinsing out the brush afterwards (note that the longer you paint the less help this is, particularly with fast-drying finishes). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some guides may give both or just one of the above reasons, and may go on to state that it helps prevent the paint from wicking up into the base of the bristles inside the ferrule but they're completely wrong on this, &lt;em&gt;it actually has the reverse effect in practice&lt;/em&gt;. This should be perfectly logical, thin liquids wick much better than thick liquids. But if anyone has doubts try comparison tests and see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to help prevent finish getting up into the ferrule is to never load the brush more than halfway up the bristles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-09T15:41:00.350" CommentCount="5" />

As @Pete mentioned in his answer the glue joint is stronger than the wood it's holding together. That is, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can apply &lt;strong&gt;enough clamp pressure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have &lt;strong&gt;smooth surfaces&lt;/strong&gt; before gluing them together. A jointer, planes or just sanding helps in that regard.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The type of wood plays a role as well, though if you only use 2x4s from the hardware store like fir, spruce or something alike you should be good.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you mentioned that this is your first woodworking project, my guess is, you don't have a jointer or other fancy power tools that would ease up the creation. Hand-planes are not too expensive though and you can achieve satisfactory results with them (and a little patience, practice and perseverance) as well. If those aren't an option either, make sure the surfaces that are glued together are as straight and clean as possible by sanding them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cut a rabbet vertically and slide them in - rabbet along the grain may not be strong as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the rabbet would give the joint even more strength, as well as help you align it and avoid slipping when you glue it up. Gluing long-grain is what you actually want to do as it is considered a strong bond when gluing. For more details on different grains and their strength in glue joints please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/4233/what-are-the-different-grain-directions-and-how-do-they-affect-joint-strength&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Drill 5/8&quot; holes in them and use circular hardwood dowels&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do this in addition to gluing, that would provide a pretty strong joint that wouldn't come apart any time soon, but in my opinion a severe overkill. Also worth mentioning with this approach is that it can either be optically disturbing, or a really beautiful addition to your piece as the dowels will stand out (in color) quite a bit after you've applied a finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Sources on the Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these points above are valid from 2x4s up to 2x10s or even bigger stock I think. I suggest you watch a video by Steve Ramsey about '&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Esvb64fUQ10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What You Need to Know About Glue | WWMM BASICS&lt;/a&gt;'.

If I understand your project correctly you're planning on putting something on top of your pedestal, which would only put pressure from the top of the piece. If that is the case, strictly speaking some nails to connect the pieces would suffice as there will be no forces exerted from the sides and the joints don't necessarily need to be that strong.

This is both aesthetically less pleasing and potentially a weakness depending on what the pedestal is for (not really a problem for indoors though). So it's better to use a mitre joint of some kind:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpPop.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpPop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quadrilinear leg sections&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above image is for what's called a quadrilinear leg (intended to show quarter-sawn figure on all four faces) but obviously the same joints can be spaced apart to produce a post such as you're making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the best of these, the lock-mitre joint at the right, requires a specialist router bit sized to the thickness of stock you're using. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A plain mitre joint, the option at left, doesn't glue as strongly as we'd like as it's end-grain to end-grain, but it's the simplest to produce by far and reinforced in some way it's strong enough for many applications. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcing it can be simply a matter of hammering in some nails/brads or spacing a few screws. The screw heads would obviously be very visible so if desired they can be hidden by counter-boring and using wooden plugs, which can become a decorative feature (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3612/what-joining-methods-would-be-best-for-the-legs-and-other-areas-of-a-height-adju/3613#3613&quot;&gt;previous Answer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can achieve much the same look and nearly the same strength by drilling through the mitre and glueing in dowels. In either case, screws or through-dowelled, the mitre joint should be glued up and left to fully cure before doing any drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T06:47:57.717" CommentCount="3" />

That should pretty much tell you all you need to know here :-) People underestimate the innate strengths of wood all the time so don't worry, you're not alone in this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you pass the consideration for &lt;em&gt;strong enough&lt;/em&gt; you can then pick the wood based on other factors. Cost is probably the starting point for most of us, but durability&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and aesthetics should perhaps be the primary concerns past that. They don't necessarily have to be considered in that order, given that a great many woods pass the standard for strong enough and durable enough (including softwoods) it could really be said to be all about looks at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is Cherry a good choice for a dining table?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes.

Walnut typically should be tougher — published Janka hardnesses for black walnut and American cherry (Prunus serotina) are 1,010 and 950 respectively and other numbers for walnut are higher too.

Here if you went with a painted base for example it could be made from 2x material for all anyone would know looking at the completed table!

The fastenings that go into the arms at right angles to the grain in the top must allow for the top to expand and contract with changes in internal moisture content through the year.

So a fairly well-worn adage of woodworking &quot;creates joints stronger than the wood itself&quot; can literally be true&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The glue industry's own testing, independent lab tests and any well-run test done in the workshop will invariable show this, where if a piece is broken apart you can expect that splits will largely happen in the wood and will essentially ignore the joint lines&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End grain | end grain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;End-grain to end-grain joints are the weakest glue joint. They can be made much more secure by very good surface preparation and by &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/840/gluing-end-grain/851#851&quot;&gt;sizing&lt;/a&gt; the end grain ahead of final assembly, but in general for any joint requiring good strength simply glueing together end grain won't be strong enough&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Visualising the grain in wood as being like straws and end grain as being like the ends of these straws helps explain why it bonds poorly normally, because those open ends of the straws are very absorbent and capillary action transports glue away from the surface, leaving too little behind to form a good bond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What sizing does is seal or partially seal the straws, preventing over-absorption of the glue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long grain | end grain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Long-grain to end-grain joints are naturally somewhere in between the above two. They were/are considered fairly weak, and woodworking guides will nearly often say that they need to be reinforced in some way — by nails, screws or dowels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without reinforcement they can be too weak to rely on &lt;em&gt;in isolation&lt;/em&gt;, but, if done properly (which would involve sizing the end grain prior to final glue-up) they can actually be strong enough in some situations without any mechanical reinforcement, e.g. because other joints in the piece will help hold things in place and everything mutually supports itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] This is sometimes erroneously expressed as &quot;glue is stronger than the wood itself&quot; which is not strictly accurate. In general it is only &lt;em&gt;the glued joint&lt;/em&gt; that is stronger, NOT the glue, and it's important to bear this in mind so that you don't make the mistake of expecting glue to support gaps &quot;because it's strong&quot; (usually it's not). Epoxy if one of the few glues commonly used by leisure woodworkers where you can rely on it to fill gaps strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Because this is so universally shown to be true it can be used as an acid test of glueing procedures by any woodworker. If in their testing the glue joints fails they can be confident that either they've done something wrong, or the glue is at fault. Possible causes of a weaker long-grain to long-grain joint include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The wood not being smooth enough — rougher surfaces don't normally bond well with most glues used in woodworking, a notable exception being epoxy. As a rule you want &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; smooth surfaces on your wood for the best glue joint, smooth &lt;em&gt;but not burnished&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The joint faces are not flat enough, e.g. the angle is off so the edges don't make good contact along their entire length.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Insufficient clamp pressure. With most wood glues you want to clamp hard enough that all excess glue is squeezed from the joint, which in practice means you want to clamp &lt;em&gt;very firmly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Glue is too thin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Glue is too thick (too dry).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Glue has has 'gone off' in some way, by being frozen or because it's aged.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not enough glue was applied (an excess of glue should &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be applied for maximum bond strength). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another cause is just a failing of procedure, so that even with perfectly jointed wood and new glue you don't get a good joint. The classic reason for this is where glue was applied but then the joint wasn't brought together in time, so the glue dried out too much to form an adequate bond (either to the other piece of wood or to the glue already applied to the other piece of wood).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] This is not to say that end-grain to end-grain joints are never strong enough. The classic small box has mitre joints on all four corners and because of the small size and the lack of stress on the structure of the piece these joints can be perfectly acceptable and are in fact widely used. But once a box needs to hold any major weight or needs to be robust enough to withstand lots of movement or rough handling then either the mitres need to be reinforced (e.g. with a spline) other joints should be used instead (e.g. finger joints/comb joints, box joints or dovetails).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-12T16:24:33.357" CommentCount="0" />

It is very dimensionally stable, one of its prime selling points. And while it's not as stiff or strong as ply it is as a rule more stable these days (because of the falling standard of plywood, while MDF is easier to make to a reasonable standard consistently).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As often mentioned MDF can bow under its own weight (a point regularly used with glee by its detractors). But that is when it is used flat as in a shelf, not edge-up. When it's oriented vertically it is much stronger and far less likely to sag, which is also true of any solid wood and ply incidentally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.6m (that's nearly 12 feet for Imperial users) is a very long span though, I hope the plan wasn't just to attach it at the ends and let the middle float. It shouldn't need much, just one or two points of attachment should do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An additional concern here is whether you can source MDF in a 3.6m length. If that's not the case the span won't be a single piece of material anyway, so a join of some kind will have to be devised and implemented.

To be frank though the volume is so low at that point that few would mind the waste of throwing it out, or otherwise disposing of it — see next point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use the settling method you're left with a small amount of sludge in the bottom of the container (it can literally be just a spoonful or two from a large jar used to rinse brushes all year) which can be disposed of safely in your regular rubbish collection.

While the glue used in chipboard can be the same as that used in MDF but it's not finely spread though the matrix of the material as it is in MDF and as a result the cutting edge contacts actual chunks of glue. Just from a few experienced working it with hand tools chipboard seems to be perhaps &gt;20 times more abrasive O_O&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And of course there are a great many tough or hard hardwoods that would be far above MDF which is soft enough to easily dent with a fingernail. Some hardwoods are merely much harder, e.g. purpleheart, African blackwood, but a few woods (commonly tropical hardwoods) contain silica and this makes them notorious for quickly dulling cutting edges, e.g. teak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How fast can it dull? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a &quot;How long is a piece of string?&quot; kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How wearing any material is to cutting edges depends on many factors, the quality of the steel probably being the most critical. Note: not just the steel alloy itself &lt;em&gt;but how it's hardened&lt;/em&gt;. It's not at all difficult to start with a good, even excellent, steel and end up with a mediocre blade because it wasn't hardened properly. This is not an uncommon issue with low-end chisels for example where the steel may not actually be poor as usually stated (it would commonly be a perfectly reasonable high-carbon tool steel) it's just poorly heat treated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edge geometry is also important, the shallower the bevel the greater the tendency towards blunting. For a chisel a shallower angle would make it much more effective at slicing through wood, so there's a tradeoff. With most plane blades though the included angle on the edge is much less critical to performance (a 10-12° difference can be barely noticeable) so you can hone specifically to make the edge more durable if needed without a significant hit in planing resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastEditorUserId="380" LastEditDate="2016-06-26T23:10:40.133" LastActivityDate="2016-06-26T23:10:40.133" CommentCount="0" />

It's generally referred to as wet-and-dry, wet-n-dry or wet-or-dry paper (with or without the hyphens) as well as wet/dry paper. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And note that 'sandpaper' is especially a misnomer here since this type of paper isn't, and has never been, made from sand. The most common abrasive used for paper like this is silicon carbide (sometimes shortened to SiC, so the paper may be referred to as &quot;SiC paper&quot;). Usually when someone says SiC paper they mean wet-and-dry paper&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, since the abrasive is a dark grey or black in colour they'll sometimes be referred to by colour&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. And as if that's not enough, some older guides will refer to the paper as carborundum paper, since SiC is also sold originally as carborundum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See previous Q&amp;amp;As for a little more related info:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2062/is-all-fine-grit-count-sandpaper-called-wet-dry&quot;&gt;Is all fine grit count sandpaper called wet/dry?&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I tried using a bit of it and it seemed to work fine. So what's water sandpaper for?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, not for sanding wood. It can of course sand wood and it'll do it well, since the abrasive is sharp and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hard, but some finishing gurus say that it shouldn't be used for sanding wood because of its dark colour, which can be obvious on certain lighter-coloured woods if any abrasive particles get stuck in pores or grain and can't easily be removed when you're done sanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few previous Questions here that cover how this type of paper is commonly used in woodworking:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1420/leveling-a-finish-finishing-the-finish&quot;&gt;Leveling a finish/finishing the finish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3658/how-do-i-de-nib-polyurethane-after-it-dries-but-still-maintain-its-finish&quot;&gt;How do I de-nib polyurethane after it dries but still maintain its finish?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/756/how-do-i-achieve-a-piano-black-high-gloss-finish-on-wood&quot;&gt;How do I achieve a &amp;quot;piano black&amp;quot; high gloss finish on wood?&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final quick note, it's important to bear the following in mind when reading American woodworking and finishing guides when using P-rated papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P-rated paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There are two main classification systems used for abrasive paper, CAMI and FEPA. CAMI is the American system which uses a plain number, FEPA is from Europe and has the P before the number. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P-rated papers generally produce a slightly more uniform scratch pattern (fewer scratches that are deeper than expected) because the abrasive grit is more accurately screened, so there can be a much narrower range of grits bound to the paper than on a CAMI paper. Obviously good results are possible with papers classified either way, but in general it's more feasible to skip grits when sanding using P-rated papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the two systems share most of the same numbers they don't unfortunately correlate across the whole span of grits :-( Within the narrow band of grits used most commonly in woodworking they are roughly equivalent, so 220 and P220 are nearly the same, but once you get to higher numbers (finer grits) they begin to diverge and for example 600 grit paper is actually nearly equivalent to P1200!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/TlldC.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/TlldC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CAMI v FEPA&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 It's possible that all abrasive papers or cloths that use silicon carbide can be used wet, so regardless of the name used it may &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; refer to a waterproof abrasive even when that is not specified. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 Not all grey papers use silicon carbide however. Light-grey papers, usually fine to very fine, are sold for smoothing/flattening finish and these are made from aluminium oxide (more commonly seen in abrasives in its red form, as used on most sanding belts and sheets for powered sanders of all types).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-19T10:34:11.063" CommentCount="3" />

Wax is a resist, nothing will stick to it properly but more wax. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now obviously you've used an oil/wax blend which isn't just wax, but there's still wax in there and it will affect adhesion of a varnish topcoat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ideal fix here would be to skim off the surface of the side tables, just removing a few thou should be enough to get below the treated wood fibres (penetration of all finishes is surprisingly shallow in nearly all woods, except on end grain). This can be done by sanding, scraping or planing, or a combination, whichever process(es) you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's probably a good idea to then clean the freshly surfaced wood down with solvent to remove any last traces of the existing finish that may remain, unless you go deep enough that you're sure you've exposed pristine wood. If you want to do the solvent thing start with a few wipes of mineral spirits then finish up with something stronger like acetone or lacquer thinner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might possibly get away with just thoroughly cleaning the surface with the solvents, but I wouldn't be inclined to rely on this alone myself and it would require copious amounts of solvent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;prevent water stains&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way of looking at this: do your end tables actually need protection from water? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they're to be used regularly for holding drinks then a polyurethane varnish is a great choice as a topcoat, but if they aren't then the oil/wax blend you've used already is a perfectly acceptable finish for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Arm-R-Seal in satin is a really popular choice&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I would recommend you get gloss varnish, thin it to wiping consistency and then wipe it on.

So yes, you will get irregularity but the process factors it in.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also these joints would not require the level of tight fit that you'd want on the dovetails on fine furniture. Sloppy fit would be much more acceptable here, even desirable given the difficulty in interlocking over such lengths, and as you say it's not like this needs any strength to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could use a router to hog out the centres, for speed and to reduce the effort needed, but an additional benefit of using hand tools for almost all the wood removal is that it gives almost total control over tearout if you do it right as all the cutting processes go &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the wood, never exiting on long grain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why this isn't a viable idea&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room: the little cubes of the cut joint are all short grain.

Then I cork up from there, for me 220, 400, 600. 220 works very well I just love the really high grit. And for 'is there noticeable sand marks' I would have to say no. When I do mine you can not see the sanding marks. But I am using Satin so that may make the difference.

The harder and tougher the wood the more you'll need to sharpen, and without exaggeration this might mean you need to stop to re-sharpen every couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, historically we had no HSS or carbide-tipped tools of course. Until very recently all turning was done using some kind of high-carbon steel, so there's no technical reason it can't be done, it's just that you will need to sharpen much more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related to this, &lt;strong&gt;edge geometry&lt;/strong&gt; — because of the stress on the edge, even when using much stronger steels it's common for turning tools to be sharpened to a much steeper bevel angle than you'd use on carving or bench chisels. Gouges for example can have a 70° outcannel bevel, not the 25-30° more common on a carving gouge, so once converted the tools will require a lot of work (i.e. a lot of metal will need to be ground off) to change them back to the kind of geometry that's better for carving. So you can't really expect the same tools to do double duty I'm afraid, broadly speaking it's one or the other and not both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I say above, despite how it may come across I don't want to dissuade you from trying this. After all many people have made their own turning tools from screwdrivers (mainly scrapers and parting tools) and &lt;em&gt;usually without further hardening the tip&lt;/em&gt; and that is saying something as screwdriver tips are deliberately not made as hard as the steel can get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nfuV4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nfuV4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shop-made turning tools&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; American Woodworker, Feb 1994.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For extra penny-pinching points, assuming it's not too late, don't throw away the crappy tool you got with the lathe.

It sounds like a fun project, but watch out for potential catastrophic failure of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first metal tools used by man were copper and copper alloys (bronze and brass). The main problem with these metals is that they are much softer than steel, thus holding an edge for less time and also in a greater risk of bending the tool itself (and not just the cutting edge). Aluminum in pure form (i.e. not an alloy of aluminum) is even softer than copper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A further issue is with the quality of the casting. How well can you create a uniform alloy and then cast it so that the finished tool will not have any voids or weak spots due to poorly mixed alloy or other flaws? Any such issues will impact the strength of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a large difference in metal hardness with different treatment methods after the initial casting. Metals most often can be annealed (softened), tempered (toughened) and hardened. A good tool steel alloy can be hardened to twice (or more) the hardness of the original steel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for some numbers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness_comparison&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;comparing different hardness scales&lt;/a&gt; is difficult, but just so that you have the right impression):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the most commonly used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_scale&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rockwell hardness scale&lt;/a&gt;, steel and copper/aluminum don't even use the same scale (there are HRC for steels and HRB for softer metals). Typical tool steel is about 60 HRC, while brass (which is harder than pure copper) is about 70 HRB. However, 70 HRB is much softer than even 1 HRC.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinell_scale&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brinell hardness scale&lt;/a&gt;, tool steel has a hardness of about 700, while aluminum is 15 and copper is 35. And just for comparison, hardwoods have a hardness of 3 to 7, so your aluminum tool might be only slightly harder than the wood it is cutting. I would imagine it would be like cutting pine with an oak chisel. The most dense hardwoods are probably even harder than copper (woods like Lignum Vitae).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, since you are asking about tools for a lathe, I would be very careful. Lathes exert a lot of force on the turning chisels, and it might cause a catastrophic failure, especially if there is some flaw or void in the casting. The tool might snap suddenly, sending shards flying at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end, it does sound like a nice project to try out, but I would start from tools that don't have such a high risk of damage. A marking knife would be a good start - it will allow you to assess the edge holding capabilities of the metal you are working, and would be pretty safe should the tool suddenly break. Then I would step up to small hand chisels (not for lathe work) and then progress from there if results are satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="534" LastEditorUserId="94" LastEditDate="2016-07-18T23:26:29.603" LastActivityDate="2016-07-18T23:26:29.603" CommentCount="3" />

General advice to help prevent shelves from bowing includes not mounting the brackets right at the ends (although this is sometimes unavoidable and with some shelf material it's fine, especially if the loads are going to be light) and not positioning heavy items in the centre of a shelf as this exerts the greatest bending force. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Distribution of the load across the width of a shelf, or putting the heaviest items right over the supports can often be advised. Another method that's not as commonly recommended is for when the brackets are not mounted right at the ends of a shelf, and here you can put heavy items on each end (outboard of the brackets) which can counterbalance the tendency towards sagging from a heavy load in the middle, within reason. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may need more specifics than can be provided here so visit one of the go-to resources online, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodworkingtips.com/etips/etip01.html&quot;&gt;the Sagulator&lt;/a&gt;, if you need to calculate how much sagging you can expect for your chosen shelf material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also like to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodworkingtips.com/etips/etip01.html&quot;&gt;Shelving Spans for Bookcases&lt;/a&gt; on the Woodsmith etips site, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.compositepanel.org/userfiles/filemanager/78/&quot;&gt;this PDF&lt;/a&gt; from the Composite Panel Associations, a technical bulletin on the use of particleboard and MDF for shelving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-07-08T08:12:48.773" CommentCount="1" />

The jigs would be much like those in the following pic, made for doing the recess to take a hinge:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/htI9c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/htI9c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Router hinge templates&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cut-out in the template is made a little oversize (by a fixed amount so easy to make the necessary adjustments to your measurements) and a collar/guide bush projecting from the base of the router will follow along its inside edge. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're cutting through the full thickness of the material in one pass turn the speed on the router up to full and progress the cut at a measured pace, &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; attempt to force it to cut.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rounded corners&lt;/strong&gt;: a router will naturally produce rounded internal corners, which are usually squared up. This is commonly done with a chisel, but you can also use a corner chisel or the 'shell' of a mortising bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't fancy doing that you can actually leave the corners round. For the toe-kick especially I don't see an advantage to making the corner square and having it rounded is less usual so you could consider it a feature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the front notch that will accept the horizontal board you would have to round over a short portion of the two inside edges of the board to get it to fit in the notch properly. This isn't particularly difficult, although you may want to practice once or twice on scraps before doing it for real. Again after carefully marking out to start with you can do this by paring (using a chisel, carving knife, sharp penknife), paring then sanding, just by sanding or with a file, whatever you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastEditorUserId="243" LastEditDate="2016-07-12T09:46:43.717" LastActivityDate="2016-07-12T09:46:43.717" CommentCount="4" />

The second will account for most of the cutting action of the bit and luckily is the easiest part to do. The work can be done using a fine file, the edge of a diamond plate or abrasive stuck to a stick. Use push strokes only and aim to follow the existing grind angle, any burr that is raised should be easily knocked off by driving the bit into a piece of scrap hardwood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The circular rim can be tackled similarly to honing an outcannel (outside bevel) gouge, although you don't need to get the edge anywhere near as refined as we need on a carving gouge or bench chisel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with a gouge the goal is to just work the bevel, then as lightly as possible remove the burr from the inside. You don't want to take any noticeable amount of material away from the inside as you'll alter the diameter at the cutting edge, which in addition to creating a worse fit for the plugs can cause them to more easily get stuck in the bit (or the bit to get stuck in the wood).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The abrading can be done by stroking the bevel as you rotate the bit with your fingers*, working against a sharpening stone (use the side of the stone if it's accessible to prevent dishing the face), a diamond plate or again abrasive stuck down onto wood. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The burr on the inside circumference would conventionally be removed by stroking gently with a cylindrical sliptone. But a piece of medium or fine abrasive paper wrapped around a dowel will do just as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Some older guides suggest the opposite approach for tackling certain curved edges, holding the tool steady in one hand and the stone in the other, stroke it across or along the edge in an arc. You can't cover the entire circumference in one go, you do a section at a time until you've worked the entire edge. Initially you'll probably find it difficult honing this way but it's worth persevering until you get the knack because it's a useful technique to have in your sharpening repertoire as you can eyeball the edge directly as you're honing it, rather than the usual situation where the bevel is hidden from view underneath the tool.

As I look at your design it appears that you have thought this out very well.  So I thought it might be helpful to our readers to discuss the key features your design addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dovetail connection will primarily serve to keep the table top flat and connected to the legs.  It will experience the most stress when the table is being lifted or shifted.  Lifting the table will apply force to pull the top and legs apart and the connection must resist that.  The force will be applied to the beveled surface of the wedge and leg contact surface.  IF the wedge is snug against the bevel cutout in the leg and is deep enough to prevent tear out of the wedge point under load, it will work.  While you made the wedge hidden, I would be tempted to make the wedge wider than the width of the leg and both glue and screw it to the underside of the top to insure maximum resistance to the tension force applied during lifting. If the table is shifted or turned in place this will apply some lateral force on the legs and a twisting force between the top and leg assemblies (if the legs are still in contact with the floor). I believe that the combination of the buttons and wedges should be adequate to resist this applied force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the table is in place the load on the top will apply downward force across the leg assembly horizontal support arms.  Since the leg vertical parts are angled the bottom of the legs will want to slide further out from the center.  This will place load on the connection between the horizontal and vertical leg parts. The legs will attempt to close like a pair of scissors. The fact that you have made the connection deeper there acknowledges this.  I would use full depth mortise/tenon connections to maximize glue connection between the two parts to resist the force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the legs resist the scissoring force adequately, which they should, the leg as a whole will try to rotate down at the center.  The button connections (which allow for seasonal expansion/contraction of the wood top) near the center of the top will carry the brunt of this force as a tension force pulling the button away from the top.  This force will be at least partially cancelled by the downward force of the table top, but some pullout force on the buttons may also be experienced when the table is in use.  Make certain that the buttons are also strong enough to resist any pullout load both in the contact between the button and the top and in the slotted connection between button and leg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that is not clear in your images is that although you have a spacer between the vertical parts of the leg assembly, another spacer on the horizontal legs would be helpful to keep the legs rigid without depending upon the top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1821" LastEditorUserId="1821" LastEditDate="2016-07-18T14:42:25.243" LastActivityDate="2016-07-18T14:42:25.243" CommentCount="3" />

Routing out the interior flat area is a simple matter of proper jigging and depth control. But you will need to chisel-cut the inside corners and invest a lot of time sanding out the panel area. A router will not leave a 'finish' grade surface when the bit is acting as an end-mill. The best bit to use would be an up-spiral 3-flute bit with 1/2&quot; shank. Bit diameter of 1/2&quot; probably best when balancing strokes necessary to rout down versus difficulty. You'd need to set up two jigs - one as a perimeter jig and another as a platform to ride on the frame while routing down to panel surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BUT... That approach is not the only approach to the &quot;MDF Shaker Door&quot; problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With MDF as the material, and a router as your only tool (unless you say otherwise), the simplest approach I would suggest would be using two thicknesses of MDF, one for the frames and one for panels. Rout the frame as a unit from the thicker stock, rout a rebate on the back side to accomodate that panel, chisel-clean the corners of these from rounded to square. Then rout the panels out of the thinner stock and glue the panels into the frames.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That will get you there, but is wasteful of the thicker MDF stock (the lost middle parts), and the unsightly joint on the back side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do this using the least amount of material, and again with only a router, approach it as a true panel door. Rout the Stiles and rails of the door as individual items from thicker stock, rout a groove into the inner-facing edge to receive the panel (groove size to match panel material). Rout the panels from the thinner MDF sheets. Rout out some splines from the thinner stock, to match depth of groove times 2 and as long as the stiles are wide. Assemble doors with glue, sliding splines in from ends until they contact the panel. Clamp flat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, no matter how you go about this you are in for a fair amount of labor. My personal preference would be for the wasteful but simple way, as it asks the least sanding time after assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in closing, I suggest that you reconsider using MDF at all if that is an option. While it is cheap and in common use it is really not the best stuff to use for a number of reasons. For an inexpensive shaker door, solid pine and pine ply panels would look as good and hold up better over time.

Not only is a v-block more simple to make, but you can hold the workpieces tight against it, so there will be no movement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make the v-block, just clamp two blocks to the table of the drill press:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/m8ui0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/m8ui0.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To locate the fixture:&lt;/strong&gt; in order to locate the fixture so that the center of the workpiece is under the drill, first mark the center of an example workpiece. This can be done with a center finder or with calipers. Loosen the clamps. Mount a needle in the drill press. Adjust the workpiece until the point of the needle touches the center mark on the test piece. Gradually tighten the clamps while maintaining the adjustment of the test piece until they are tight and the workpiece is still exactly centered. This procedure has to be repeated if there are sets of workpieces which are of different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional notes: a permanent v-block can be made by bolting two pieces of wood together. Also, if you have a slotted drill press table and the work piece is 2&quot; or diameter or less you can use 1-2-3 blocks to make this setup. The advantage of 1-2-3 blocks is that they have threaded bolt holes, so you can bolt them together, then bolt them to them to the drill press table quickly. Also, if you have 4 1-2-3 blocks, you can bolt more blocks onto to the end to make a larger v-block.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="306" LastEditorUserId="306" LastEditDate="2016-07-23T18:31:50.740" LastActivityDate="2016-07-23T18:31:50.740" CommentCount="7" />

What you'll end up with is not that different in principle to how some Mid Century Modern pieces have their round legs attached. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One caveat though, I do think you'd be better off using two dowels if you plan to lean on the table much when it's in use. A single dowel placed centrally will allow for a lot of twisting or warping of the top (far more than you'd guess, even if the top is very thick and stiff) so adding two legs would be much better. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're set on using just one leg mount it off-centre, toward the side you plan to sit at.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a piece like this photo, either square or round &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'd need to make this but it's a simple enough operation, just requiring cutting the wood to size and drilling a suitable hole through it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this joint were described in woodworking guides I bet it would say that ideally you'd want to create a shoulder on the dowel (essentially forming a circular tenon on its end, the drilled hole in the block then becoming a round mortise) but given the way this will be mounted I think that's complete overkill. With a good tight fit* between the dowel and the drilled hole you'll get an excellent glue join, and once the block is firmly attached to the tabletop from underneath the leg isn't going anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;which I can glue to the board&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't glue the board to the tabletop, use screws at each corner instead.

And avoid picking a piece that has a knot in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Go for a tight fit but in practice you might not find this possible, as the dowel may be a fraction smaller than the available bit despite them being nominally the same diameter.

The only real difficulty might be in perfectly mounting the cylinder in line with the axis of rotation, especially if turning between centres.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table saw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As odd as it might seem this can be done on the table saw, and with surprising speed and efficiency, but you don't end up with the smoothest surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The method is to raise the blade just high enough that it will remove the amount of material you need, then carefully hold the dowel to the mitre gauge and slide the wood over the blade. You use either a series of passes or  carefully rotate the dowel by hand, cutting the shoulder first and then nibbling away the rest of the material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Router table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you're doing a number of these this should be done using a simple jig to hold the work (easily made in just a few minutes). But just for one you can simply clamp two battens parallel to each other between which the dowel will be placed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mount a small straight-cutting bit in the router, then set the bit height much as you would for the table saw method above, just enough projection that you will mill off the amount of material needed to give you your final diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You use the fence as a stop, positioned so that the near side of the bit will meet your shoulder line. You slowly push the dowel into the bit and rotate it with your fingers or by rolling with the palm of your hand. The bit will simply mill off the wood you don't need, leaving a very good surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drill press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There are a surprising number of ways of doing this using the drill press. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory at least you can do this using a suitable tenon cutter and possibly even a hole saw, finding ones of suitable size would be the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The method given above for the router table gives a clue to what I think is the best method for doing this with a drill press, in theory at least. It's essentially the same method upside down, with the cutting tool positioned above the dowel and not below it, but the problem is the difficulty in finding suitable bits today to do this kind of cutting at the speeds that drills run at. Drill router bits were relatively common only a few decades ago but now have almost disappeared. However, with a little creativity this may be feasible using a Forstner or similar bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the Comment above from keshlam suggests this could also be done as a turning operation on the drill press (the workpiece being held vertically). While I don't agree personally I should mention that many people don't like the idea of using the drill press this way as they believe it puts too much sideways stress on the bearings. Doing it lathe-fasion on the drill press if you want to turn down to size using any type of chisel you need to rig up a vertical tool rest off to one side, but without a rest you can do this quite easily with a file held in the hands. Stop and check your diameter frequently! It would be very easy to overshoot the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the machine operations have one critical flaw, that really you could do with running a test (possibly more than one) to check your setup before committing to doing the work on the finished piece. Doing it by hand you can more safely start work directly on a single piece because the rate of material removal is far easier to control working at handtool speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is the method I think you should use if you only need to do it once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need only one saw, a sharp cutting tool and a file to smooth out and refine the shape (or abrasive  wrapped around a block of wood).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First step is to mark your shoulder line on the dowel, and the diameter you need on the end grain using a compass or dividers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you carefully saw down to the required depth at the shoulder line, working around the circumference. If you're not confident you can saw to the correct depth don't worry, err on the side of caution and deliberately saw shallow. You can easily make up for this in the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you simply pare or whittle away most of the wood that needs to come off, working either towards or away from the shoulder as you prefer and according to the grain direction. You can use a chisel or sharp knife here, even a marking knife can be used for this sort of thing if it's sharp enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you are down close to your desired diameter either switch to using the file or sandpaper, or stop paring/whittling and begin to scrape the wood with the edge. Final smoothing should be done with a file or abrasive paper, always backed with a hard block.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might sound crude but this method is capable of achieving very good accuracy if you work slowly and carefully and stop to check your diameter on a regular basis — you'll feel like a chump if you go to this much trouble only to remove too much material and end up with a loose fit :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-07-24T09:00:53.560" CommentCount="6" />

There are various tips about how best to accomplish this without issues, here's a summary from various sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thicker plywood is a better choice when attempting to screw into edges. 18mm or 3/4&quot; is often the minimum thickness recommended so you're good here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always centre the screws on the thickness of the plywood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Drill suitable pilot holes (note: &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2708/are-there-specific-types-of-screws-i-should-use-for-woodworking/2714#2714&quot;&gt;clearance holes and counterbores&lt;/a&gt; are needed in the piece the screw goes through).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Squeeze the faces of the plywood with a clamp when driving the screw in to physically prevent it from splitting or bowing. This can be worth doing even if using self-tapping screws.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't screw near a corner (even if using the clamp trick). Place screws at least 5-6cm from a corner.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pick your screws with care.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Glue the plywood butt joint, that way the screws aren't being relied upon for strength but are mostly there to initially hold the case together while the glue dries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as per the above you should ideally glue the edges of your ply to the case sides but you may want to avoid that for a few reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the surface plies of modern plywood are often too weak (too thin, and not bonded well enough) to reliably glue to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it makes assembly much more difficult and frustrating if you've never done it before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;much less glue squeeze-out to clean up when you're done (this is surprisingly difficult to do properly, and even harder on plywood surfaces than on solid wood because of the way the veneer is peeled from the log). However, you can protect adjacent surfaces with tape to prevent the problem in the first place, similar to how it's used &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2813/should-i-finish-before-during-or-after-assembly/2815#2815&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to protect joints from finish.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I do not know what length screws to use and the distance between them and dowels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer is better for strength, but increases the potential for the screw to split or bulge the plywood at the edges. But screw &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; is arguably more important than length. Basic wood screws aren't ideal for plywood, although they can work OK. &lt;strong&gt;Confirmat screws&lt;/strong&gt; are often recommended for use on plywood due to their superior holding power but common &lt;strong&gt;chipboard screws&lt;/strong&gt; should work perfectly well and are far easier to find, these screws are made to hold in material much less dense than you'll find in the edges of plywood so should hold extremely well in anything better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've selected your screw it would be advisable to do a few tests screwing into some offcuts of your plywood, because the quality of ply varies so much what one person has had success with does not guarantee success for you, using a different make or type. Test to find out what size of pilot hole works best and whether or not you need to clamp the plywood to help prevent it bowing or splitting — the larger the diameter of pilot hole the less the chance of these problems, but at the cost of lower holding power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told the dowels you're planning on using as well will add a lot of strength here, much more than they often do in a joint (in solid wood). If you're buying lengths of dowel and sawing it down yourself you should groove the dowel pegs to aid them being driven home, see previous Question, &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3841/how-can-i-flute-my-own-dowel-or-create-dowel-with-similar-properties&quot;&gt;How can I flute my own dowel or create dowel with similar properties&lt;/a&gt;.

A softwood is not nearly as strong and will be more prone to splitting especially if the molding is attached with screws (as shown).  Consider using a hardwood for both the molding and the 2x6 parts.  If you use  a hardwood, you could use a 1x6 for attachment to the wall.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;attachment method.  You show screws to connect the molding to the 2x6.  I would recommend attaching the pieces using PVA (standard wood glue). This will be plenty strong enough for the load.  If you do use screws pre-drill the holes in to prevent splitting the wood when the screw is installed.  Drill the hole in the molding just large enough to allow the screw to slide in without turning and the hole in the 2x6 approaching the diameter of the screw shaft so that for the most part, only the threads are engaging the wood.  Do not over tighten the screws.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grain direction.  IF screws are used, I would recommend that the grain direction for both the hanger and the molding be side to side rather than vertical to prevent splitting and pullout of the screws over time (the screws are very close to the bottom of the 2x6.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mounting the 2x6.  Be sure that the screws used are long enough to reach into a stud in the wall at least 1 1/2&quot;.

Although pine is quite strong if used the right way the tank does represent a very significant load and it may be too much for the thickness you've used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However I think there's more going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There are additional concerns in relation to how this is constructed, with the vertical supports cross-grain to the top. As I was writing this I realised there are actually two problems with this, not just the one I first saw. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is common to all furniture with similar tops, where there must be allowance for the panel to expand and contract with changes in internal moisture level. As we can't see how the top is attached (if at all) to the upright panels it's impossible to tell if this is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Switching to oak wouldn't necessarily be a solution as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was going to write initially that if you changed to top to plywood (see Note bottom on plywood type) it would avoid these issues — there are no worries with cross-grain attachments and it is inherently stiffer so will naturally try to resist bowing under load. But then I realised the following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue with the uprights is not so obvious but is potentially just as serious if not more so as it's still a factor even if the top were switched to plywood. &lt;em&gt;Being built as they are their axis of expansion and contraction is vertical&lt;/em&gt; so when those are expanded they will push upwards on the top. This wouldn't be a problem necessarily, except for the steel posts to either side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And conversely when these uprights contract they will tug on the top downwards if they're attached securely to it. If on the other hand the top just floats on them when they are at their driest point they could shrink enough to leave a gap between their upper edges and the top, which of course could be a direct cause of it bowing downwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; although it's a good grade of plywood it shouldn't be considered necessary to use marine-grade ply in this application, as although it is around water there isn't the expectation that it'll constantly get wet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-02T08:19:54.243" CommentCount="2" />

Some people aren't a fan of any finishes that add more yellowness to maple, preferring to keep it as light as possible by using a 'water-white' finish (most waterbased finishes, or lacquer), while others don't mind the yellow/orange tone imparted by shellac or varnish. Pick your poison. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one caveat I'd add is in relation to highlighting any figure. Because this beetle attack and staining can occur on any random acer, ambrosia maple planks can also exhibit the whole range of features seen on unmarked maple (both soft and hard). Where this coincides with rippling or 'curly' figure in particular I think the finishing regimen should seek to highlight the rippling as you would otherwise, as IMO it's a crying shame to see this finished in such a way that it looks a bit flat, like on the left here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5IaJQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5IaJQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rippled figure unenhanced v. enhanced&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One additional concern would be if you have areas that are punky, I don't believe it's anything like as common as on conventionally spalted woods but sometime the fungal attack has gone a bit too far and made the wood soft and spongy, and it's a PITA to try to work it and finish it. Often consolidating the area with a penetrating wood hardener, or superglue, is the only way to get a good surface and even at that there can be some slight textural difference between it and the unaffected wood which are only hidden if you build a full film finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There's also the question of whether to fill the holes with colored epoxy or leave them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm of two minds about this, while I'm a fan of filling holes/voids usually (I like the look and that you don't leave a hole which can trap dust and other crud, making them very ugly) the holes here are a specific feature of this wood so it might actually be desirable to leave them, to showcase them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastEditorUserId="243" LastEditDate="2016-08-05T06:45:40.507" LastActivityDate="2016-08-05T06:45:40.507" CommentCount="6" />

And if they are why are they? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As per the above it depends on who you ask, so this becomes largely a matter of opinion rather than there being some definitive yes/no checklist you can refer to showing what species should and shouldn't be used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The example of western red cedar helpfully provided by Adam Zuckerman already is a perfect illustration of this, as not only is this species used for boards it's sometimes specifically chosen for use with food &lt;em&gt;for the very chemicals it contains that make it an irritant&lt;/em&gt; (Google &quot;planked salmon&quot; for more). Some of the aromatic hardwoods chosen for burning when smoking food are also good illustrations of the same principle, because someone out there is likely to hold the opinion that &quot;they shouldn't be used for boards because they'll taint the food&quot; or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of outright toxicity, not something like irritant/potential irritant properties, there are no woods you might buy and would consider using in a board that qualify, so you can put that worry out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing you should focus on here as the woodworker is &lt;strong&gt;the risk to you when making the board&lt;/strong&gt;, not any danger for the user from the completed board in any normal way. So while a given species might be perfectly fine in a board, you might want to avoid using it rather than risk exposure to its dust when sawing, routing or sanding it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What should I look out for when making a new cutting board?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the only part where I think you can get input that isn't merely an opinion, because it's about wood's physical properties. And the primary bit of advice is not to combine species of widely different properties in a cutting board, for durability reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably the main thing to focus on is avoiding combinations of species which have markedly different coefficients of movement (see table at the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3441/what-is-the-maximum-width-for-a-full-cross-grain-glue-up/3533#3533&quot;&gt;this previous Answer&lt;/a&gt;). This is for structural stability, because where pieces that expand more are locked between pieces that expand less it could put great strain on your glue joints and eventually split the board. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; it doesn't matter if the glue is completely waterproof or how strong the glue joints are, because if necessary the board will split the wood itself apart to relieve internal stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing to bear in mind is using woods with very different hardnesses, if you're concerned with how the surface will retain its looks. So for example pine can make a perfectly acceptable wood choice for a board but it shouldn't be combined with something like hard maple because the pine will wear far more than the maple over time, leading to an ugly mismatch of surface textures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-04T08:50:27.833" CommentCount="0" />

You may be able to somewhat address it by using a box spring or sheet of plywood across the top, but if the mattress is going to lie directly on this frame, I'd be concerned about that center beam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the other question, your design's legs appear to be very long but they don't have anything to reinforce them against racking. You may want to consider using wider but thinner lumber, as opposed to more square lumber for the outer frame. Although you will still want some additional reinforcement against racking with such long legs, a wider board will give you a longer and stronger joint between the legs and the frame. It will also be more resistant to deflection than a square beam if you orient it with its narrower edges facing up and down, and it will make your design stronger since you won't have to cut halfway through them in order to accommodate the cross bars in your design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third weakness involves all those cuts into the load-bearing parts. Some might argue that they are not very visually appealing, either, but that judgement is up to you or whoever will be using this bed.

When you calculate the load that the main beams will carry you must ignore the depth of the notches and calculate the sag/load based only on the depth of the continuous wood below the notches.  I would also caution you regarding the use of the 3-way miter.  This is not a joint for beginners.  It will need to be tight, so unless you have been at this for a while, experiment first for practice and to evaluate the joint's strength.  Rob also point out that this joint must resist racking forces.  The constant lateral loads on the joint will encourage movement and a softwood will give over time  making the joint sloppier, which will increase the racking. In the link for the 3 miter joint you provided it shows that the joint is held in place by the three small square tenons that extend into mortises in the intersection pieces.  These pins are all that is used to resist the racking forces.  I am not sure this joint is up to the task using softwoods and I certainly would not use a joint like this at all unless it was glued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1821" LastActivityDate="2016-08-06T03:36:00.080" CommentCount="0" />

You can choose to deliberately for one or two reasons, but you can do just one or the other if you want to simplify things, reduce the number of products you need to buy and slightly speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a computer desk I would personally go with varnish myself as it's the toughest of the alternatives you're considering (a bit more on this below) and perhaps just as importantly for you, it can be just as easy to apply as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(its a bit harder to find in the UK)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Polyurethane, or poly for short, isn't harder to buy in the UK than it is in the US, it's just harder to identify. Any varnish you buy could be (might even be &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; to be) polyurethane already, it's just that we name some of our products differently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you buy a varnish and it happens not to be a polyurethane it will be one of only a few variants and all of them are suitable to use as a final finish in their own right so no need to worry about this too much. In general if a varnish plugs that it is scratch-resistant then that's all you really need to know for certain application such as your computer desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Would I need to apply polyeurethane or another layer after applying either the oil or the varnish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's one of the classic things that gets muddied online, you don't need to polyurethane after varnishing because &lt;em&gt;polyurethane is varnish&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poly is just one particular type of varnish, although some purists like to classify it separately they're wrong to do so as 'varnish' was never one thing, as long as there have been commercial varnishes sold there have been different versions available with various strengths and weaknesses. Polyurethane is just one more in a long line of varnish innovations going back hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for &quot;Danish oil&quot;, despite the name it is not actually an oil. More accurately it's classed as an 'oil finish' but even that is a bit of a misnomer, because although it largely consists of oil it is in reality a blend of oil and varnish (with some or a lot of additional white spirit). This is one of the main reasons I'm not a fan of the commercial product — it's so easy to make your own. On top of that it'll be much cheaper while also giving you the freedom to vary the ingredients as you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;will the oil affect the colour of the wood too? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All finishes affect the colour of the wood to some degree. Waterbased finishes and lacquers change the colour of wood the least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oil will in general affect the colour the most, deepening the tone and imparting some yellow-orange or amber colouration. Oil also increases contrast the most, magnifying grain patterns or figuring in the wood, which is why it is sometimes deliberately used in combination with varnish, to enhance the grain (called &quot;popping the grain&quot;) prior to the final finish going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Varnish will generally affect the colour just one step down from pure oil (note: this refers to oil-based varnish only).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &quot;Danish oil&quot; is somewhere between oil and varnish it affects colour approximately in the middle, generally more like oil and less like varnish though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this assumes an uncoloured varnish or &quot;Danish oil&quot; product, there are of course many coloured versions available which will make the wood redder, browner or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I am thinking of using Danish Oil or a Walnut Satin Varnish. The surface is going to be used for work, eating and drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either one of those is suitable for your requirements here if applied correctly, the main thing being that enough coats are used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want maximum protection from hot mugs, spilled liquids, scuffs and scratches, go with varnish as this builds up a coating on the wood (varnish is a &lt;em&gt;film finish&lt;/em&gt; not a penetrating finish, because it builds an actual film on the surface).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To ease application and ensure good results I would recommend thinning the varnish to turn it into what's called &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/4355/protecting-against-water-damage/4356#4356&quot;&gt;wiping varnish&lt;/a&gt;, then wipe it on with a rag. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; the rags should be spread out flat to dry otherwise they pose a fire hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] You'll find unnecessary steps promoted as a must-do-every-time (my favourite of which is sanding between coats of varnish &lt;em&gt;to guarantee adhesion&lt;/em&gt;, because this is nonsense) and occasionally important steps are omitted.

Most of the time when woodworkers say &quot;seal the wood&quot; they're speaking informally...... &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; informally, because most coatings only do a partial job of isolating the wood from its environment and some do almost nothing! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Products that will 100% waterproof wood include bartop finishes, marine epoxy coatings and fibreglass resin, but in addition to their waterproof nature for a complete seal it also requires them to be put on thickly, the equivalent of perhaps 20 coats of regular varnish, so there is a very significant coating on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news is I don't think you need to go that far. Because many similar habitats I've seen, built mostly from plywood, seem to be finished off in basic coatings (probably varnish, based on the appearance and guesswork) and not in something visibly thick and with a slick, high-gloss finish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that if you use a decently water-resistant material (e.g. a suitable grade of plywood and/or any solid wood that &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3959/what-is-an-easy-way-to-seal-wood-for-outdoor-garden-use/3965#3965&quot;&gt;naturally does well outdoors&lt;/a&gt;) and simply varnished it thoroughly that you'd get the performance you want.

You should be clamping if strength is important at the end of the day. The only common glue used by woodworkers that doesn't require any clamp pressure is epoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note you're dealing with some end grain with these pieces and when you glue end grain it will inherently lead to weaker joints, most especially if it turns out that end grain will be bonded to end grain. But if you're alternating the grain direction from one piece to the next like this |–|–| there are no end-grain to end-grain joints to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What are good methods for gluing such small pieces? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you're glueing the pieces one at a time to their neighbours to build up strips which will eventually be brought together to make up the checker board. If so it's not a good idea. In addition to being inefficient working that way small errors can build up and before you know it one row of eight is fractionally longer than another and your finished pattern is spoiled. Worse still, you can easily end up with a row that curves very slightly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be much better, if possible, to glue all the squares in one operation using a slow-setting glue and this is the type of thing where a clamping rig comes into its own. This can be a temporary setup, something made up on the bench using dogs, the vice etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can then apply pressure from all four sides at once, as well as from the top with a clamping board and cauls, or just very heavy weight placed on top (e.g. concrete blocks*) to keep everything flat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a clamping board shown in a previous Answer &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/m0yk2.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that shows how a simple clamping rig can be thrown together based on a sheet of plywood. In this case you'd tack or screw on four stops or fences, making sure that at least one corner is a perfect 90° angle. Wedges and packer strips if necessary bridge the gaps to the other two fences and apply the necessary clamping pressure side to side and top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now all that aside, there is this...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it's usually done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The classic way to build up a chequerboard pattern means you are never dealing with individual squares or blocks at all. Instead, you glue up long strips of your alternate species into a panel which is then cross-cut into strips:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/YyC0M.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/YyC0M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Checker board strips&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every second strip if flipped end for end and then everything is finally glued up into the completed board pattern.

See &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1321/whats-a-bench-hook/1327#1327&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s a bench hook?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1846/planing-thin-stock-without-the-aid-of-bench-dogs/1860#1860&quot;&gt;Planing thin stock without the aid of bench dogs&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option gleaned from old books was that used for creating thin wedges for use in joint work. You chisel a small recess (in effect, a short stopped dado) into a surface in which the workpiece can be set so that some of it projects, it can then be planed. In the old days this sort of thing would often be chiselled directly into the top of the bench, but again you can throw together a quick bench hook for this purpose instead so that you haven't created a permanent divot in the top of your workbench :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-11T08:57:20.907" CommentCount="4" />

In general if you can find a paint that specifically plugs its durability it will include an ingredient or additive that improves scratch-resistance and usually resistance to chipping as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The bed will probably be plywood and pine or poplar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly the wood underneath the paint plays a part in how well the topcoat holds up if it's subject to knocks and scrapes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In brief, the softer the wood is the more easily it can be dented and dents along edges and at corners are places where paint can crack and start to flake or peel off. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So given a choice between modern 'pine' (which can be a number of commercially grown softwoods, but all tend to be quite soft) and poplar I would suggest you go with poplar if the budget allows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;My thought was to prime it, then put two or three (as needed for proper color coverage) coats of paint (most likely Sherwin Williams). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Priming is a good idea on general principle but I must add that wood is one material where priming is by no means a must-do, because paints in general bond &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well to clean wood.... just &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to get it off when you've made a mistake and you can see how well!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does it need more coats of paint&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two or three coats is almost always enough on interior pieces, but for high-traffic areas four might be worth the effort. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would resist the urge to add more coats because weirdly past a certain point applying more coats doesn't incrementally add to the durability. For paints on woodwork once you pass about five coats the paintwork can end up &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; durable, not more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;any polycrylic or similar sealant, sanding between? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can apply a clear coating over paint but whether it's worth it depends on the paint really. Over certain paints varnish is a must-do if you need a wear-resistant finish, but interior trim paints and that sort of thing are specifically formulated to be a topcoat or final finish and have durability built in. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as a rule you shouldn't need to use a varnish or other clear coating over paint if you pick the right type.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Would glossy be preferable to satin paint? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably makes no significant difference. It's said that glossy paints are most durable but the difference between full gloss and satin/semi-gloss is likely to be minimal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Anything else I'm missing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All surfaces to be painted should be equally 'clean'. This isn't just about removing finger grease from handling, wood itself exudes stuff over time that can hinder the adhesion of paints (just as it does with glue).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So try to have all surfaces freshly sanded before painting. Just a light pass with fine-ish paper (280-320 grit) following the grain should be sufficient if there's no visible grubbiness. Obviously this is a lot of sanding so you can concentrate your effort on areas that will see wear, on the backs of panels etc. you can probably safely skip this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you go with primer your process might be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sand all important surfaces lightly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wipe off dust.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Apply primer and let it dry thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Apply paint as per directions (see point below though). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wait for the paint to dry/cure thoroughly before putting it into service. For waterbased paints I'd wait at least a couple of days, for oil-based paints I'd give it a week if you can.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that it can help to achieve a good finish if you slightly thin the paint, for the first coat or two at least (adding 5-15% of the appropriate solvent). It's usually wise not to exceed that level of dilution, especially for paints thinned with water, except for a first 'wash coat' or primer coat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you choose not to prime it might go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sand all important surfaces lightly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wipe off dust.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thin your paint approximately 30-50% &lt;em&gt;for the first coat only&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Apply finish coats of paint just as above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wait for the paint to dry/cure as per the above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-12T15:30:36.990" CommentCount="2" />

It's the same starting out in most areas, where you have to learn about lots of things knowing that eventually you'll use just a handful of them 95% of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a great many options available and numerous combinations possible on top of that but I know a couple of woodworkers online who use wiping varnish for virtually all their pieces. And I've read on one furniture maker's blog that he uses nothing but linseed oil on his work, saying that if it was good enough as a finish for hundreds of years it's good enough now. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm going for a more uniform appearance, with grain showing of course, but I'd like to de-emphasize the grain &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to truly hide the grain on oak and produce the most even colour possible then a full grain fill is the way to go but this is a lot of extra work. You can go a lot of the way there just with the right colouring product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the classic case for picking your colouring product with care as what is sold as &quot;stain&quot; is a number of very different things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of &quot;stain&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There are two main classes of stain, pigment stains and dye stains, and they work completely differently. A pigment stain has actual pigment particles (large) suspended in it while a true stain is coloured by dye (very tiny). With pigment stains those particles naturally collect in recesses, actually increasing the contrast and making the grain stand out. Dye stains on the other hand colour the wood fairly evenly so have a natural tendency to reduce the contrast between the recessed grain and the surrounding wood. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also &quot;get stain&quot; which isn't strictly a stain at all. It is coloured varnish that has been artificially thickened slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's definitely dye stain you want to use here. Get a dye stain or two in likely colours and experiment with them until you're confident in how to apply the product evenly. For your final finish I would recommend wiping on varnish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've read good things about oil/varnish blend and about wiping varnish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are both fine in their respective ways and for appropriate applications. They both have the same basic advantage, that of being wipe on finishes but wiping varnish is a better finish in a few key respects, being more flexible in how it can be applied and providing better waterproofing and scratch-resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In case you haven't come across this before wiping varnish is just normal varnish thinned slightly. As with &quot;wood conditioner&quot; you pay too much for the commercial variety because they're charging you through the nose for mineral spirits, which is cheap. Better to make your own since it's much cheaper and you can have full control over the level of dilution to suit your own preferences and the weather conditions (the same dilution won't equally suit finishing during summer months and on the coldest days of winter). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is take a clean jar and pour in some (gloss) varnish, then add 1/3 or more spirits, shake the jar and you're good to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oil/varnish blends can be made in exactly the same way, usually beginning with a simple 1:1:1 mixture of BLO, varnish and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that shaking a finish is usually discouraged just prior to use because it introduces bubbles but they're irrelevant in a wipe-on finish because the application process will naturally pop any bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Of course I'll make multiple samples of all the potential processes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's good.

When the branch is sawn into planks the release of this stress can lead to very bad warping. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is not to say you shouldn't try to use branch wood. There is much fine wood wasted because it was originally in a branch, but you'll never be sure how much it might warp. However confine yourself to smaller pieces and work in stages to your final dimensions and often you'll have few problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;would there be a huge difference in how I should treat the wood between cherry/pear?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No I don't believe so. I think you can treat most hardwoods and fruitwoods equally when it comes to drying out pieces like this and get approximately the same results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is this a problem if they are cut into small cubes as appropriate for an end grain cutting board?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/1nW7n.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/1nW7n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Branch end-grain wood uses&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But obviously make sure the wood is fully dry (or &lt;em&gt;seasoned&lt;/em&gt;) before you use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since the pieces will be small pre-glue, do I still need to let the wood cure for ~1yr? (I've read that green wood should be cured?) If so, should I leave it in long square sticks to cure, should I just leave it sitting in the compost pile for a year or should I cut it to cubes and then leave it to cure for a while?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definitely don't leave it in a compost pile! Leave the pieces as-is (I think this is referred to as &quot;in stick&quot;) to dry before dimensioning and glueing. They can be dried outdoors (off the ground and under cover) or in an airy space indoors (e.g. a well-ventilated garage or covered porch).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for how long to wait, there is a rough rule of thumb about drying green wood given out a lot online, saying to allow one year per inch of thickness. While this is for hardwoods specifically (a detail often left out when the phrase is repeated) and obviously will vary somewhat even among hardwood species it is a good conservative timescale to have in your head for any drying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further to this I would say myself, &lt;em&gt;wait as long as possible&lt;/em&gt;. It's almost never a bad thing to wait longer when drying wood compared to doing the opposite — in normal circumstances wood can't be over-dried, but it can most definitely be under-dried!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For future reference if you get a chance to acquire wood like this, you want to cut it up into the pieces you'll be drying and immediately &lt;strong&gt;coat the end grain&lt;/strong&gt; with something to protect from cracking. Don't be complacent and wait until the following day or later in the week, you can start to get cracks forming in just that little time. The goal is to prevent the formation of cracks entirely, not halt them spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best thing to use for sealing end grain for the DIYer is &lt;strong&gt;melted wax&lt;/strong&gt;, which should be applied liberally. Any solid wax will do, from canning wax to virgin beeswax to random bits of old candles. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't&lt;/em&gt; rely on &quot;latex&quot; paint for this. Despite how frequently it's recommended online for this purpose it's a bad choice as it's a terrible water barrier. The only reason to use this type of paint would be if you literally had nothing else on hand that would do the job better. In the absence of wax things that would work better than &quot;latex&quot; paint include enamel paint and varnish, both of which have good water-resistance.

Even on soft softwoods this can be enough to reinforce the surface and make it strong enough, while not properly hard or resilient, to withstand the knocks and scrapes of daily use. You probably have some offcuts you can test this option out on and if it does enough I can't imagine it not being the cheapest of the possibilities presented here, but it would be slow to do and you'd want to wait at least a week after the last coat for the varnish to cure hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I should have thought of this myself but a friend of mine suggested something that would be effective here if, as with the solid-surface material, you don't mind that the wood is obscured and that is &lt;strong&gt;tempered hardboard&lt;/strong&gt;.

Based on their video on the 225 blade, this is for a tool that we (in the US, at least) would call a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.milwaukeetool.com/power-tools/corded/6519-31&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sawzall&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (even if not made by Milwaukee) and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YPF%2BHR1vL._SL1500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YPF%2BHR1vL._SL1500_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YPF%2BHR1vL._SL1500_.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Image courtesy of Milwaukee.com&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you click the &quot;Sawzall&quot; link (above), you'll see that depth of cut isn't mentioned in the specifications. This is because it's an open ended cutting tool, and the only limit to the depth of cut is the length of the blade. The Milwaukee site does indicate a 1 1/8&quot; cutting &lt;em&gt;stroke&lt;/em&gt;, but that won't limit how long a blade it can push.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For your purposes, just about any &quot;sawzall&quot; (using the brand name as a generic term for reciprocating saw), will do the job to cut through your foam and cork. As an example, I've used my 18-volt battery powered &quot;sawzall&quot; (manufactured by a company who painted it yellow and black) with a 12 inch pruning blade similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.northerntool.com/images/product/400x400/442/44299_400x400.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.northerntool.com/images/product/400x400/442/44299_400x400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://www.northerntool.com/images/product/400x400/442/44299_400x400.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;courtesy of Northerntool.com&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've used it to cut limbs from downed trees, and to cut down dead trees in the yard. I've also used it (with appropriate blades) for demolition work and other general purpose, non-precision cutting. Probably not the most powerful tool made, most likely has less oomph than a corded tool would, but cuts like a champ until the battery dies. The good news is that I have several batteries, so I just plug in a freshly charged one and put the dead one on the charger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, the biggest issue you'll have is getting your cuts to come out accurately with a tool like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;However&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really mean a &lt;em&gt;saber saw&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1423/what-is-the-difference-between-a-sabre-saw-and-a-jig-saw&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;jig saw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2pbmlo3fglvvr.cloudfront.net/product/full/Z0s5v0jcpEx_.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2pbmlo3fglvvr.cloudfront.net/product/full/Z0s5v0jcpEx_.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;https://www.zoro.com/makita-jigsaw-orbital-cutting-0-3000spm-jv0600k/i/G4928716/?gclid=COPuiurf2s4CFQwwaQodffkKrg&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#lightbox-Z0s5v0jcpEx_JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;image from zoro.com&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you would need something from WILPU&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; that is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wilpu.com/en/products/jig-saw-blades/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; of their site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the jig saw is that you'll get much better control over your cut, giving you a much more accurate cut. Also, jig saw blades are usually much narrower than the narrowest &quot;Sawzall&quot; blade, and will make much tighter curves. The drawback, is that I've never seen a jig/saber-saw blade that was 300-450mm long. This doesn't mean they don't exist, I've just never seen one (WILPU's catalog shows their longest jigsaw blade looks like it's 155mm - less than 1/2 what you need).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;If you need the depth of cut, I'd suggest using the &quot;Sawzall&quot; blades you've linked with just about any reciprocating saw out there (caveat: you, generally, get what you pay for). I'd suggest cutting wide of your line, then sanding to bring it your final dimensions. (If you have plenty of spare material and time, you can practice cutting right to your line to learn the tool and get better control)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on some of the comments on your question, you could try a hot-knife. You indicated that you'd tried a couple and found that they were either too short or didn't work well. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=diy+hot+knive&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;quick Google&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/Hot-wire-foam-cutter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; (among others) at Instructables.com for a DIY hot knife foam cutter. The advantage of this is that you can make it as big as you need it. It also looks to have a variable power setting and quite a number of tips from readers on improving it, so you should be able to ramp it up to cut your foam. It's also cheap enough that if it doesn't really work you're not out that much cash.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; No specific recommendation of WILPU blades (or Milwaukee reciprocating saws or Makita jig saws).

If you're plunging to a shallow depth and then moving across the work piece, the center that wasn't removed in the initial plunge gets removed by the cutters as you move the router.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only problem I've had with bits that don't remove the center has happened when I was trying to make a deep-ish plunge without moving the router bit. Then the center hits the bit and prevents you from finishing the plunge cut. But these bits don't look like they'd have that problem, though it's hard to tell from the angle of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I'd recommend trying it out on a scrap to see whether they work. From the description of the cut you are planning, I think you'll be fine, but testing on a scrap is always the best way to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of any bits that are designed for plunging per se, but normally when I make a plunge cut with a straight bit, the exact bit I choose depends on which surface I am more interested in having come out clean. If I want the bottom of the cut to be the cleanest part, I would use a spiral upcut bit. The flutes on these bits are cut in a continuous spiral around the bit shaft, which helps evacuate chips as they are cut. Spiral upcut bits leave a clean surface on the bottom of the cut, at the expense of having a small bit of raggedness on the top surface of the cut. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I care more about the surface being cut into more than the surface at the bottom of the cut, I will just use a regular straight bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also spiral downcut bits, which are similar to spiral upcut bits, but have the flutes running in the opposite direction. These leave a very clean cut on the surface being cut into, but require a slower feed rate than spiral upcut bits, and are better suited for more shallow cuts. As for myself, I've never had a problem with the edge cut by a straight bit, so I've never bothered to buy one. And for completeness, I'll say there are also bits that combine spiral upcut and downcut flutes into one bit, but as far as I'm aware, these are usually quite a bit more expensive, and are mostly used for CNC operations that benefit from having a single bit that is good at everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="283" LastActivityDate="2016-08-24T22:15:10.247" CommentCount="2" />

I'm wondering what the best finish to use would be. I have no experience finishing wood. I want to go for a natural look, and I also want a durable finish that does not require too much maintenance. I would certainly hope that glasses don't leave permanent rings on the desk. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about polyurethane's look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bed has a number of components (posts, mattress and safety rails, a desk, a ladder, bookshelves, mattress slats), so it's possible that different parts need different treatment. If I'm too busy, I might choose to only finish the desk, as the manufacturer says that they recommend finishing the desk, but that other parts of the bed can be left finished or unfinished. However, I'd certainly prefer to finish the visible parts of the bed if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether I want to stain the bed at all. I like the color of natural pine, and staining it would be additional work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google research originally brought me to Waterlox Tung Oil finish, and I think the oil finish look is something I'd like, but the long curing time has given me pause. It seems from the instructions that I should apply 4 or more coats, each of which takes a day to dry, and then leave it for another 3-4 days before assembling, after which I'll need to make sure my bedroom is cross-ventilated for a couple months (which I think would necessitate replacing my AC with a window fan). It's not necessarily completely unacceptable, but it poses some complications for me. I'd either be working in a not-so-ventilated basement workshop (with standard Waterlox), or I'd be doing it mostly outside (with marine Waterlox) and be careful about rain and sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are my other options?

It's not only that it means the pine is used as pine (not trying to pretend it's something else) but it and other similar softwoods are notorious for staining badly, giving awful blotchy results.

Merely waxing the wood is one of the simplest options of all if aren't leaving the wood bare, it provides nearly no protection to a functional piece (why it's not classed as a finish in its own right by many people) although it's fine for small things like decorative turnings and boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simplest of all oil finishes are actually plain oils of vegetable origin (nut or seed oils) and a key benefit of them and not a wood finish or polish of some kind is that oil is the sole ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there are no solvent vapours or other VOCs to worry about, making it ideal for application indoors in a domestic environment. Cleanup also doesn't require solvents, just soap and water is all that's needed. In contrast, Tung Oil Finish will typically have a large solvent component (usually accounting for more than 50% of what's in the tin!) so it has a very pronounced solvent odour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The principal finishing oil is linseed oil, specifically what's sold as &lt;strong&gt;boiled linseed oil&lt;/strong&gt; (BLO for short). There is also raw linseed oil but this dries very much more slowly and has different uses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other main option is tung oil, this gets many recommendations today which I think personally are misplaced*. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would very much recommend BLO. I should mention that boiled linseed oil does have a characteristic smell which some people don't like, but many adore it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Info and tips on applying an oil finish from previous Q&amp;amp;As:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3145/why-is-there-a-progressive-reduction-in-oil-for-finish-maintenance-is-it-necess&quot;&gt;Why is there a progressive reduction in oil for finish/maintenance?

Don't leave them bunched up as they are a fire hazard. Leave them to dry flat on the floor if you can, or draped over the back of a wooden or metal chair, once stiff and hard they are safe to dispose of in the household waste. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This previous requirement is however a problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I would certainly hope that glasses don't leave permanent rings on the desk. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about polyurethane's look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An oil finish is not water-resistant. About the only thing you can apply that is virtually guaranteed to protect the wood from sweaty glasses is varnish unfortunately, with polyurethane being one of the best (and easiest to buy) choices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for your purposes consider varnishing only the desktop portion. It isn't uncommon in furniture work to finish tabletops with a full protective finish and have the legs and other components more lightly finished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Varnishing conventionally to a high standard is not easy, but there's an excellent workaround for that these days and that's thinning the varnish and wiping it on. This converts a regular varnish into what is sold as &lt;strong&gt;wiping varnish&lt;/strong&gt;. It's much easier for the novice or first-timer to achieve a great finish with wiping varnish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More details in the following Q&amp;amp;As:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/3601/what-is-the-difference-between-wiping-polyurethane-and-wiping-varnish/3602#3602&quot;&gt;What is the difference between wiping polyurethane and wiping varnish?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/4355/protecting-against-water-damage/4356#4356&quot;&gt;Protecting against water damage&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The characteristic look and feel that I think you're not a fan of shouldn't be a problem if you wipe the varnish on. If you do end up with a slightly glossier finish than you'd like you can reduce the shine very effectively by wiping the surface down lightly with a nylon scrubbing pad/pot scourer (clean of course!) Use light pressure and stroke in the direction of the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*There is no real benefit to using tung oil for an interior piece — it's more difficult and slower to build up a good finish (slower in the sense of taking longer to do as some sanding is part of the recommended method), it dries more slowly on top of this so the wait times are longer, plus on top of it all eventually it ends up looking the same as if you'd used BLO. And you pay more for all of these advantages :-) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tung oil is reputed to build up to a more waterproof finish, but there are faster and more reliable ways of achieving that end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastEditorUserId="243" LastEditDate="2016-08-26T05:47:12.363" LastActivityDate="2016-08-26T05:47:12.363" CommentCount="5" />

Shadow lines can emphasize or hide a feature. Since they are created by the lighting of the work piece the importance of the lines can change according to the direction and intensity of light.  A simple wooden box displayed in the sunlight will change in character depending upon the time of day and direction of the sun.

The first thing is, if you're in the US, &#xA;&lt;em&gt;you are probably surrounded by board materials on a daily basis&lt;/em&gt; because of the building practices used there. This means your 'background levels' of any VOCs from plywood and other board materials would already be high, this is a fact of modern life and not something to be overly scared about and it puts into context what must amount to a tiny increase in exposure from occasional use of a solar oven. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, similar cooking devices (including hot boxes, for passive cooking) have been made from plywood for many decades. In that time I'm sure someone would have noticed if there were a noticeable risk and the word would start to go around, and we know this is the kind of thing that would spread like wildfire and never go away — whether well-founded or not&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now don't take this as a guarantee of any kind, but &lt;em&gt;I'd&lt;/em&gt; say this is likely safe enough that it should fall below your worry threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are still concerned though, for security run the oven a few times before you use it to heat food. It's probably a good idea WRT the paint if nothing else. The coat of paint will benefit from going through a number of heating cycles, forcing it to release more volatiles as well as greatly speeding up the curing process compared to leaving it at room temperature. You can gauge the success of this by smell&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] Two similar examples I can think of off the top of my head are MSG being responsible for &quot;Chinese food syndrome&quot; and cellphones being a fire risk at filling stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Two samples of paint applied on the same day where one was heat-cured and the other was just left at room temperature will be in very different states on day three or four. The former should have nearly no odour while the second will still have that characteristic odour of fresh paint (indicating that VOCs are still being released). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-29T08:14:11.620" CommentCount="0" />

In either case the legs can certainly carry the vertical load.  However, the legs are shown on an angle from vertical and this will place a greater deal of strain on the joint between the horizontal and vertical elements of leg assembly. To resist this I would definitely use a deeper profile to maximize the gluing surface between the two elements.  I would use a mortise and tenon connection, and if possible a double mortise joint to provide maximum strength against the pressure to have the leg splay out in the direction of the angle.  Better yet would be to have a vertical leg to avoid the lateral force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the case is built using plywood or MDF the wood movement will be minimal and can be ignored.

Only on quite small projects can you get away with ignoring it completely (if using solid wood). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If so, how would I adjust for that so I don't get a split?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing in the overall design that needs to be adjusted, but there are a few areas to pay attention to. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertical divider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In case it's not obvious you need to orient the grain of this vertically to match the case, so that expansion and contraction occurs back to front and not up and down. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you oriented the grain on this horizontally at maximum expansion (during the wettest part of the year) the panel would exert enough force that it would probably bow the top and bottom, and if the back panel were fixed in place it could split it or tear it free from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back panel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I would recommend you make this from plywood or another board material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you make it from solid wood the grain &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; run horizontally and it would be highly advisable to make it up from quarter-sawn wood to keep dimensional changes within reasonable limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is a little over-engineered by the way. Two leg frames that aren't joined at all would be fine here, but go ahead with it as designed if you want the practice in the joinery. If you would like to simplify it slightly the cross-members can be joined with half laps/halving joints instead of with M&amp;amp;T joints which aren't necessary for strength here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How you join this to the case is critical. Since the leg assembly is much like the legs and apron on a table, and the grain on the case is as it would be on a tabletop you should basically attach the two together in the same sort of way. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2720/will-these-table-legs-support-this-table/2731#2731&quot;&gt;this previous Answer&lt;/a&gt; for two good simple methods. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*If this does occur you don't necessarily need to re-cut the components however. Instead you could glue using epoxy, which is a very good gap-filling adhesive (most common wood glues are not). Fill the epoxy with fine sanding dust to a thicker consistency if necessary, aim for a viscosity anywhere from around thick honey to that of mayonnaise. Use a slow-setting epoxy to give yourself plenty of time to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want even further security in addition you could peg the tenons through the face of the joint. Glue the tenons in first, wait for the adhesive to set then drill and peg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="243" LastActivityDate="2016-09-01T07:21:49.667" CommentCount="2" />

If not, look at your router speed and feed rate, as well as the sharpness and design of the bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can nearly strive to have the routed surface be finish-ready. A quality router bit that's very sharp is an important starting point for this but doing the lightest of skimming passes as a last step should always improve results. One way of doing this is by running tape around the template, or on the router's fence, when doing the major shaping and then remove it for one final skimming pass (taking off wood equal to the thickness of the tape used).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;with the view to move up in grit to 320&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider sanding to a lower grit on the face grain (220/240) and a higher grit on the end grain (400 or even 600), to help even up the colour once finish is applied.

With modern plywood in particular, in addition to generally not being as well-made as plywood used to be (more voids, junkier wood in the core layers) over the years the surface ply has gotten incrementally thinner, to the point where on some plywood it's now like a sheet of paper.... and about as durable! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even very good quality cabinet plywood (note: not all &quot;cabinet grade&quot; plywood is good) has a fairly thin surface ply of the 'show wood' and wouldn't be made to have the necessary durability.

Since you can't just use the flooring by itself it would need to be mounted on a board material (plywood or OSB) which will make for a very thick 'mat'!

Problems: &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's actually very difficult to keep the joint flush and straight while at the same time somehow positioning the block in the corner, putting two clamps on, and not getting glue everywhere.

Problems:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's tough to position the wood in the clamps so that the outside remains perfectly flush. It's totally doable, but takes more finesse than I want it to. It's a many-step process to get everything set up to be flush.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I only own 8 of these clamps, which means I can only glue up 1 drawer at a time. At $10 each I'd need to buy another $80 of hardware that I wouldn't really need for any other project just to raise my throughput to 2 drawers at a time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Biscuits for alignment: Should work in theory. Problems:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In practice it's very difficult because despite how often I've practiced with this thing, I have yet to discover a good technique for perfectly straight, positioned cuts on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7O2Cs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;side that you have to cut into the face of&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. the end-grain cut is easy, but I really have a hard time keeping the biscuit cutter straight and properly positioning the biscuit on the face cut).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's tricky to design everything so that the biscuits don't interfere with the dados I've cut for either the drawer tracks or the bottom panel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Line up the butt joint, drill pilot holes, glue, and screw it together. Then remove the screws after the glue dries and plug the holes. The main problem with this is it takes forever, and still has the same difficulties holding the joint true and flush.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pocket holes: The Kreg jig just doesn't do that well with 7/16&quot; thick material, it's a bit too thin, and the plywood tends to get torn apart. Plus, same alignment difficulties when driving the screws in. Also I have to use these just as temporary screws, because since the material is so thin the screw heads hang out past the face.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nails to temporarily hold wood in place. Same set of problems as above + lots of bruised fingers. And the nails end up permanent, really hard to pull nails back out without tearing up the pieces. I don't want the nails to be visible on the outside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Drill holes, insert dowels: Aesthetically acceptable but a huge pain and has same alignment issues as just putting screws in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rabbetted corners: I can't actually figure out how to cut these quickly.

Also this doesn't really gain me anything at all in terms of speed or alignment ease over gluing the butt joints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tongue-and-groove variants: No idea how to cut these easily. Same difficulty getting the tongue and groove to line up properly as with the rabbets. Plus the plywood starts to become very weak and the thinner bits tend to snap off during assembly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how can I do this, in reality, given that e.g. my grandfather hasn't been passing on his mystical woodworking knowledge to me for the last 35 years of my life? I'm just a normal person, not one of those legendary woodworking samurais who can hand-cut perfect dovetails in 5 seconds, while drunk, with their eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm really struggling to find a quick and precise technique given my current set of tools and fine motor control skills. It's easy with large pieces but the 3&quot; x 7/16&quot; plywood seems to be introducing new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1250" LastEditorUserId="1250" LastEditDate="2016-09-04T01:46:39.910" LastActivityDate="2016-09-04T01:46:39.910" Title="Quick corner joints in practice" Tags="&lt;technique&gt;&lt;joinery&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="0" />
