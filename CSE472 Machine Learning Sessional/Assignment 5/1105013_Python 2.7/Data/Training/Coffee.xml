The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine).

Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Green Processing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp;amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Age of the Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acid Degradation over Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast.

The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, &lt;strike&gt;and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the&#xA;  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still&#xA;  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t&#xA;  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. &#xA;  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad&#xA;  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and&#xA;  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature&#xA;  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known&#xA;  or suspected carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Differences by Brewing Method&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/&quot;&gt;Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" CommentCount="6" />

For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article is helpful:&lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot;&gt;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T23:37:22.793" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:37:22.793" CommentCount="4" />

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.  Any of which can drastically alter the taste of the final product cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is such a large industry that there are studies and information out there on each step of the process assuming all other variables the same.  One could literally write a book with multiple chapters covering each step of the process.  You still wouldn't be able to come up with any definitive answers because the final step is someone's taste buds and we all have different preferences.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2015-01-29T20:07:08.770" CommentCount="0" />

Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voila!

In fact, Argotec and Lavazza&#xA;  are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually&#xA;  bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space&#xA;  Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of&#xA;  the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian&#xA;  astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha&#xA;  Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into&#xA;  space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic&#xA;  Italian espresso in orbit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its name is ISSpresso.&lt;/strong&gt; It takes its name from the International Space&#xA;  Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first&#xA;  capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions&#xA;  of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of&#xA;  liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.&#xA;  ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian&#xA;  engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and&#xA;  European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for&#xA;  in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.&#xA;  ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to&#xA;  deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it&#xA;  was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in&#xA;  the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the&#xA;  Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects&#xA;  and activities to be carried out in the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments &lt;strong&gt;Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President&#xA;  of Lavazza&lt;/strong&gt; — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into&#xA;  space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xA;  the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xA;  Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xA;  time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xA;  just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xA;  overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xA;  indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xA;  International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xA;  project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xA;  division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xA;  and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xA;  nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Our aerospace engineers — stated &lt;strong&gt;David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xA;  astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xA;  thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xA;  systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xA;  Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xA;  high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xA;  with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xA;  challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xA;  Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xA;  In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xA;  the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xA;  important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xA;  espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xA;  especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xA;  home.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xA;  national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xA;  initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xA;  technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xA;  ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xA;  with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xA;  improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xA;  astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xA;  exploration missions.

The ‘corner&#xA;  café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xA;  a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xA;  chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xA;  missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xA;  very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xA;  be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xA;  or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xA;  also be rehydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-terrestrial technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Every tiniest detail&#xA;  of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xA;  challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xA;  physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xA;  handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xA;  environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xA;  inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xA;  steel tube &lt;strong&gt;designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.&lt;/strong&gt; The&#xA;  machine is so complex that it weighs &lt;strong&gt;about 20 kilograms since there&#xA;  are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xA;  accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xA;  Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xA;  which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xA;  menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xA;  dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xA;  have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xA;  future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&quot;&gt;Just found images on The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&quot;&gt;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="31" LastEditorUserId="31" LastEditDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" LastActivityDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" CommentCount="6" />

Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the assistance of common men like me,&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjtoe.gif&quot; alt=&quot;YEAHAHAHA!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

That's the hard part. [Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz (&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html&lt;/a&gt;). That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of &quot;optimal&quot; brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it &quot;too weak&quot; and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains &lt;strong&gt;around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for &quot;optimal&quot; strength American-style brewed coffee is around &lt;strong&gt;0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bonus corollary/sanity check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;7g of ground&#xA;coffee&lt;/a&gt; maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the &lt;strong&gt;64mg/shot&lt;/strong&gt; reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the USDA and others&lt;/a&gt; also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="86" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2016-01-28T12:00:37.770" LastActivityDate="2016-01-28T12:00:37.770" CommentCount="0" />

Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day.

While it's not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having the machine professionally cleaned&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having better water delivered, and using that to brew&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2015-02-05T00:51:49.080" CommentCount="0" />

Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly &quot;bad&quot; beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I roast at home and the only time I have ever &quot;sorted&quot; is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.

I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.

I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas.

For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember also that medical studies are &lt;em&gt;chronically&lt;/em&gt; badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One tool against all of this uncertainty is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.).

For example, robusta tends to have lower acidity, but higher bitterness. If these are the attributes you attribute, it might be further robusta evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were to learn the brand of coffee being brewed, that might suggest the variety of the beans, but that's probably difficult to learn from generic, anonymous diners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-02-09T16:56:13.817" CommentCount="0" />

Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;).

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso.

The brewing process is relatively cheap and nearly uses the same amount of pressure as a actual espresso machine.

Steeping might not really the word here but here is how they do it:&#xA;The percolator heats the water from the bottom to create steam.

I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that &lt;strong&gt;soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.  My only guesses are that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;xanthan gum&lt;/a&gt;) interfere with the coagulation, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination).

Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss of heat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering your final question about duration of freshness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. &lt;strong&gt;The sooner you drink it the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.&lt;/strong&gt; You might also look into cold brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Black Bear Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T14:55:16.367" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T14:55:16.367" CommentCount="2" />

No. &#xA;What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Please just save me from exogenous variables&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh... you should have just said so.... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/kmild.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inference Tree of Acidity in Coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a conditional inference tree mapping the distribution of acidity scores to a series of categorical variables. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:&#xA;C is Country &#xA;P is Preparation &#xA;G is Green Processing&#xA;and the bar plot shows the distribution of acidity&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a variety of green processing methods in common use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please leave a comment if you'd like me to add a variable or further analysis to this answer! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="100" LastEditDate="2016-01-28T22:53:07.130" LastActivityDate="2016-01-28T22:53:07.130" CommentCount="6" />

The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think &lt;strong&gt;you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew&lt;/strong&gt; (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262&quot;&gt;this question about coffee going stale&lt;/a&gt; -- one answer says it only takes minutes!

So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning...

Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Taste&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;amp;t=833&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where all the information of this section came from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Environmental Impacts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-using-coffee-filters-7625.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that provided the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two.

There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html&quot;&gt;the use of &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; saucers&lt;/a&gt; for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm&quot;&gt;according to US government legend&lt;/a&gt;, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html&quot;&gt;eating peas off the back of one's fork&lt;/a&gt;.

Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious.

In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moka pot.

There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This pretty much explains this abnormal Swedish tradition.

Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't really rinse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's answer your second question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is being rinsed off?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2015-02-24T00:36:52.153" CommentCount="2" />

I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: &lt;strong&gt;What characteristics define real espresso?&lt;/strong&gt; Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;traditional espresso machine&lt;/em&gt; (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html&quot;&gt;this history of espresso machines and production techniques&lt;/a&gt; for one view of what is &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; espresso), and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;capsule-based &quot;espresso&quot; systems&lt;/em&gt;. There are several capsule-based espresso machines (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/&quot;&gt;here's a review of Nespresso and three others&lt;/a&gt;). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;No.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In simple point of fact, &lt;strong&gt;espresso is not &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; made with a coffee-filled capsule&lt;/strong&gt;, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html&quot;&gt;INEI&lt;/a&gt; being a benchmark of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf&quot;&gt;espresso production standards (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone&lt;/strong&gt;, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;quantity of coffee (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso&quot;&gt;Nespresso might be light&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure&quot;&gt;using pressure that is too high&lt;/a&gt;, or on the other hand &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262&quot;&gt;too low&lt;/a&gt; for extraction and crema. That said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;it seems that AeroPress can create crema&lt;/a&gt; at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maybe.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. &lt;a href=&quot;http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/&quot;&gt;One four-subject test&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;em&gt;higher marks&lt;/em&gt; to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; agrees. Another test disagreed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/&quot;&gt;giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;It doesn't matter.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), &lt;strong&gt;what difference does it make if it's &lt;em&gt;&quot;real&quot;&lt;/em&gt; espresso or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso?

For my version, I use freshly roasted beans from my local farmer's market (they roast on site), Coconut Oil, and Stevia as a sweetener. I also use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10076320/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mini aerator&lt;/a&gt; from ikea ($2.49) to mix it. This is very important unless you like an oily film on top of your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use organic Coconut Oil rather than Grass fed butter for two reasons: &#xA; 1. Coconut Oil is much easier for me to find&#xA; 2. IMO, it tastes better than the butter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried the grass fed butter, and it was pretty good, but like I said. The coconut oil is much easier to find in stores and it actually tastes better. The butter does give the coffee a creamy texture that's good though, so I'd try both just to see which one you like better. I tried the MCT oil for a while and noticed that it can be a tad harsh on my digestive system, so I cut it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for results, in addition to having a significant boost in energy in the AM, I also noticed health benefits. My good cholesterol (HDL) was through the roof at my last physical. While my LDL was really low. My Doc asked what I was eating, and I told him about my Bulletproof experiment and he said it appears to be working at least for my HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for added benefits for workouts, I don't really notice a huge difference with coffee alone. When I add a NO2 booster to the bulletproof coffee, I do feel a big difference, but that may not be for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I said all that to say, it does work...to an extent. But I'd definitely advocate a DIY version rather than buying a bunch of overpriced products with highly questionable added benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.

Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  &lt;strong&gt;My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[1] pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm&quot;&gt;pro/con overview from air-n-water&lt;/a&gt; (obscure?);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/&quot;&gt;World of Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[3] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/&quot;&gt;LiveStrong&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[4] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html&quot;&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt;, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written &lt;em&gt;a lot of text&lt;/em&gt; here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper versus metal mesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262&quot;&gt;cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time&quot;&gt;how often and how much to clean a permanent filter&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinse your paper filters&lt;/a&gt;, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; For my money, personally, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer the paper filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-02-27T22:03:44.680" CommentCount="8" />

For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a &quot;slanted&quot; puck; if your grounds are packed &lt;em&gt;more loosely&lt;/em&gt; in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this &quot;by feel&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for &quot;polishing&quot;, but not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's some controversial bits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Knocking&quot; is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the &quot;North, South, West, East&quot; topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few articles on different takes on tamping: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualcoffee.com/jun/perfect.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I Need Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/coffeeatthemoment/10-07-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" LastActivityDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" CommentCount="0" />

So when you add more &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;) flavor component to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between &lt;em&gt;&quot;100% fresh&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&quot;Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of &lt;em&gt;soap&lt;/em&gt; on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily &lt;em&gt;tasted&lt;/em&gt; if it is present.

In either case, the cup is largely &lt;em&gt;stainless&lt;/em&gt;, so you are not likely building up any patina&amp;hellip; so you are essentially &quot;washing away&quot; the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee.

Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds.

There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_Shock&quot;&gt;bar soaps, like this one&lt;/a&gt;, that make the (largely unverified) claim that some of the caffeine is absorbed through your skin. Win-win?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To keep this on-topic...&quot; As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are &quot;0.001% and 0.005%.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean&quot;&gt;Coffee beans themselves&lt;/a&gt; have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the &quot;bioavailability&quot; of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper.

In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola&quot;&gt;cola&lt;/a&gt; has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17395/why-does-adding-sugar-to-sour-things-cause-them-not-to-be-sour&quot;&gt;this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness&lt;/a&gt;). I don't see how sugar could be &lt;em&gt;the cause&lt;/em&gt; of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). &lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; That said, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; the perception of sourness, but it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) &lt;em&gt;dissipates more quickly&lt;/em&gt; than the sourness (acids), you might be left with &quot;more sourness than sweetness&quot; in the &lt;em&gt;aftertaste&lt;/em&gt; after some time. That is, you're left with &quot;un-maksked&quot; residual sourness which, though present all along, is more &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweetness&lt;/em&gt; is perceived by the presence of &lt;em&gt;sugar&lt;/em&gt; (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor&quot;&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt;).

You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Use the same water you use for drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[4] Known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html&quot;&gt;Ross Droplet Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="271" LastActivityDate="2015-03-07T00:21:07.180" CommentCount="2" />

You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.&#xA;Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  &lt;em&gt;burned&lt;/em&gt;, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. &#xA;Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all.

I recommend using cold or lukewarm water as this will allow you rub at the (layers of) stain without risk of pain from hot water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The build-up is largely from water soluble compounds in the coffee, and because the brewing process creates a concentration of these in hot water, as the brew cools these tend to come out of solution.  There will also be tiny particles of ground coffee, small enough to make their way through the filter/basket that holds the original coffee grounds, and these particles act to promote the staining/sedimentation, esp. at the bottom of your carafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've already seen the first evidence of success when the rinse water came out almost as dark as the brewed coffee the carafe normally holds.

In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; interesting!). With just about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example of drip versus espresso, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on caffeine&lt;/a&gt; (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has &lt;em&gt;slightly more&lt;/em&gt; caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (&quot;standard dose&quot;, from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;citation listed at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, those are listed as &lt;em&gt;grams&lt;/em&gt;, which means that water could dissolve &lt;em&gt;tens to hundreds of times&lt;/em&gt; as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;; also keep in mind that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262&quot;&gt;lethal dose of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time&lt;/a&gt;, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; caffeine content coffee; the point being that the &quot;other stuff&quot; (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; short indeed) you'll get most of the &quot;other stuff&quot; but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor&lt;/a&gt;; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-21T20:52:14.513" LastActivityDate="2015-03-21T20:52:14.513" CommentCount="3" />

It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help &quot;wick&quot; the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting the two types of cones:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the &quot;wells&quot; from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow &quot;seals&quot; itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for &quot;why&quot; this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the &quot;seal&quot; and permits the coffee to drain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar &quot;ridge&quot; that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little &quot;pleats&quot; in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that this &quot;pooling&quot; happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the &quot;sealing,&quot; but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide&lt;/a&gt; suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-03-23T15:35:37.900" CommentCount="0" />

Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut).

Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.

These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.&lt;/strong&gt; Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a french press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.&lt;/strong&gt; Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew.

I read on a roaster's site (I'll try to find the reference) that acidic flavors come out first, sweet compounds second, and bitter flavors last when brewing.  The trick is to stop the extraction before you get the bitter flavors.  Hotter water and finer grounds will extract faster.  Darker roasts will tend to be more harshly flavored than lighter roasts and a fine ground dark bean with very hot water might be undrinkable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would definitely experiment with your coffee.  200F water is a bit on the hot side, 190-195 is a more common recommendation.  With that temperature, start with 30 seconds, next try 1 minute and so on until you find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; so to speak.  There will definitely be a difference in the taste.

Thus explains the cost of components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example BOM for  coffee Maker&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.

An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime.

Espresso is a very specific brewing method that produces a very specific type of coffee.  Trying to mimic that flavor profile with other brew methods will generally fall short.  Using more coffee for stronger flavor is one option, but it ends up not being cost effective in the long run.  More extraction is an option, but over extracted coffee often has a flavor profile associated with it that isn't desirable as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closest you can get (in my opinion) on a budget is probably an Aeropress.  It is fairly inexpensive and makes a very strong cup of coffee using a reasonable amount of grounds that isn't espresso, but also isn't over extracted.  The downside is that it's difficult to generate crema with such a brew method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might be forced to figure out which aspects of the long black you like, then come up with a brew method that gets you close on those aspects, but is probably missing others that make up the true long black.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2015-04-08T21:35:57.763" CommentCount="0" />

The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="443" LastActivityDate="2015-04-15T19:08:46.567" CommentCount="2" />

To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?

I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I &lt;strong&gt;slowly&lt;/strong&gt; backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did all this over a six-week period.

As soon as it is brewed its flavor begins to degrade and deteriorate, which is why it always tastes much better freshly brewed.  While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.  It won't reduce the waste, but it will reduce the environmental impact somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, that in the end paper filters are biodegradable and, if thrown away along with the grounds, can actually aid in creation of compost -- a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="676" LastActivityDate="2015-04-17T19:28:48.770" CommentCount="1" />

If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests &lt;strong&gt;you might want to change other parameters of your brewing&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean&quot;&gt;this Q/A for what I mean by extraction&lt;/a&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could &lt;strong&gt;try this experimentally&lt;/strong&gt; also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way.

You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.

Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.

These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or so /that/ excuse goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive.

What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Roast&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it &lt;em&gt;just at&lt;/em&gt; the second 'crack'.

In fact, illy (red) comes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't raise your expectations &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; high, it's not really &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much better than any other very high quality Arabica.

Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best.

If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it.

No matter how long or short the grind, there is extreme heterogeneity in particle size--that is, you will find larger bean fragments with near-dust-size ones, with everything in between.  If you use a pour-over or drip brewing method, you might even see whole beans floating to the top. Not surprisingly, you'll get very uneven extraction from these different particles, no matter what the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you grind long enough to decimate all the beans, you'll find a lot of fine coffee dust and sediment in your cup. Too short a grind, and you get a lot of beans and bean pieces that can't present enough extractable surface area to the hot water, leading to a thin, weak cup. Waste of coffee, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's almost impossible to grind any two batches consistently, since grind time is dependent on bean quantity, type of roast, variety of bean--well, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.  So today you'll get a disappointing cup, and tomorrow you'll get another disappointing cup for some other reason. Therefore I recommend a &lt;em&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/em&gt; grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beans move through &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt;.  When you set your burr grinder to a certain fineness, there will be very little heterogeneity in particle size.  (N.B.  Spend more on the grinder, get a more even grind.)  This allows you to experiment with the grind as well as the quantity until it's perfect for you, then replicate that recipe perfectly every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some tips on finding the right burr grinder for your needs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prices vary from $50 to $1500 for non-commercial grinders.  I'm happy with my $350 Rancilio, which I've had for 10 years without a hint of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How you like your coffee matters.  A more expensive grinder will do better fine grinds, as for Arabic-style (i.e. Turkish, Greek, Lebanese) coffee.  If you don't drink that, don't spend more for it.  Most burr grinders perform best in the automatic drip range.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The under-$100 burr grinders still manage to throw a lot of fine coffee dust into the grind.  Do your research before buying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistency in grind is critical to good espresso.  If this is important to you, be prepared to spend as much on the grinder as you spent on your espresso machine.  It's for a good cause.

It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it.

If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs).

The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="869" LastActivityDate="2015-05-30T11:16:42.760" CommentCount="0" />

Some involve full immersion for a long extraction time, like Toddy.

Toddy might be the less expensive method, but for a plastic bin and some big paper filters I feel like a drip tower is better worth the money if you can find one for a reasonable price. You can find some drip tower/dutch coffee makers on ebay in the $90 range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I'm concerned, however, you are not cold brewing. You're just making iced coffee. I do something similar with an Aeropress. The Aeropress I would prefer for iced coffee, as it brews a concentrate. I've noticed little difference in acidity, it may seem more mild simply because it's cold and acids tend to mellow out at cooler temperatures, but once ingested its all the same(hot or cold) if you're trying to ward of acid reflux or similar. Cold brewing would actually make the coffee less acidic, rather than just mellowing out the taste of acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in trying the Aeropress method, I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy iced coffee. You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool. This method produces iced coffee in the same amount of time it takes to make a hot cup of coffee with the Aeropress(1-5min), without diluting the coffee. It accomplishes basically what you're intending to do, but with the aeropress rather than the chemex. This method will take less time, produce a stronger cup, and is a bit cheaper(the aeropress is pretty cheap).

Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="924" LastActivityDate="2015-06-12T00:34:16.983" CommentCount="0" />

You should have a grind the size of kosher salt for most drippers. Perhaps its personal taste, and I cannot argue that. However, it's typically recommended you start with this grind size and adjust to your preference. As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="924" LastActivityDate="2015-06-12T23:00:34.080" CommentCount="0" />

This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated.

I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a &quot;dried fruit&quot; taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt; (see this question/answers)&lt;/a&gt;. The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt; I've only seen &lt;em&gt;dried&lt;/em&gt; coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps &quot;fresh&quot; coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability?&lt;/strong&gt; Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the &quot;husks&quot;) -- here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea&quot;&gt;one example from Verve&lt;/a&gt;.

Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam&quot;&gt;this seminal question&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks&quot;&gt;a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt;.

In the &lt;em&gt;frob&lt;/em&gt; pass, we make just &quot;coarse&quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't &lt;em&gt;aimless&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twiddle. In the &lt;em&gt;twiddle&lt;/em&gt; pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &quot;scientific&quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &quot;controls&quot; for the quick little &quot;experiments&quot; to check each change.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tweak. In the &lt;em&gt;tweak&lt;/em&gt; pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The controls we have available are the &lt;strong&gt;grind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dose&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;water quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt;. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &quot;clicks&quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the extraction time was long, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop &lt;em&gt;just before&lt;/em&gt; the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on-the-fly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same three adjustments, &lt;strong&gt;frob&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, apply also to dynamic adjustments. &lt;strong&gt;Frob&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;coarsest&lt;/em&gt; control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. &lt;strong&gt;Twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;medium-grain&lt;/em&gt; control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. &lt;strong&gt;Tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;finest&lt;/em&gt; control is the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with more &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little finer so you can achieve the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with less &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;. (Volume is constant.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Appendix: The &quot;David Schomer&quot; method or &quot;ritual&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what I remember from the amazing book, &lt;em&gt;Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques&lt;/em&gt; by David Schomer.

You are not done rinsing until the water runs clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The water you see is the water you were about to brew with. Don't brew with brown water!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the machine is acting up, give it a cleaning cycle. If a coworker challenges you, ask them why they want to serve bad shots??! Or better, calmly explain that it's the obvious thing to do to get back on track. Unpredictable shots == unpredictable drink production times. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Super-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the &quot;oatmeal bowl problem&quot;. If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extending the analogy, suppose your friend drops by to borrow that book and you've had three bowl of oatmeal already and you offer your friend a bowl... You &lt;em&gt;wash&lt;/em&gt; the bowl first ... right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calibrating.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the controls here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print &quot;adjust grind coarser&quot; or &quot;adjust grind finer&quot; on the screen. So, the machine only &quot;sees&quot; a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) &quot;too much inconsistency&quot;. Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the numbers are &quot;too inconsistent&quot; (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks &lt;em&gt;coarser&lt;/em&gt; than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to &lt;em&gt;caking&lt;/em&gt; in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual &quot;death-spiral&quot; of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's acting &lt;em&gt;really bad&lt;/em&gt;, you may need to go &lt;em&gt;more-than-a-few&lt;/em&gt; clicks coarser. Following my own advice today took a lot longer than the official &quot;10 clicks coarser, pull 10 pairs, then adjust by pulling 3 pairs between each grind change&quot; that we currently follow (when I'm not around) probably would have done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How to know if you've gone coarse enough&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The signs I've been looking for (which I kept not getting today) is a run of short shots at around 10sec that all look the same and leave the shot glasses mostly clear at the second rinse. I also look to see if its producing dry pucks in the drawer. If the puck explodes into mush, that's what we used to call a shot that &lt;em&gt;didn't &quot;catch&quot;&lt;/em&gt; on the old machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Run of short shots + clean at the second rinse + dry pucks == take it back up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Always, always, always, calibrate from the &lt;em&gt;coarse&lt;/em&gt; side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on the fly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I posted this idea some years ago in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mjoshua.ryan/posts/229630143825012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've begun to notice a pattern in the shot times on the Mastrenas.&#xA;   The first pair from a run are short, because the brewing chamber is&#xA;   relatively cold. As the chamber heats, grinds begin to accumulate&#xA;   on the interior, increasing the effective dose (therefore proportion,&#xA;   therefore density), progressively pulling longer and muddier shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So, aside from rinsing like fanatics as you all already ought to do.&#xA;   You can:&#xA;   Before the first shot, click it finer.&#xA;   About 2 pairs into the run, click it back coarser.&#xA;   4 or 5 pairs after that, click it one more coarser. This is your&#xA;   &quot;cruise&quot; setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Larger flakes should act more like &quot;fiber&quot; and keep the chamber scrubbed. But you need to go finer at the start to compensate for lower temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If it's been a long time (&gt;15 minutes), then your first pair are not only&#xA;   cold but &lt;em&gt;stale&lt;/em&gt;. If it's your mom, don't serve her those shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Unlike the Verismos (and the Astorias, too, for that matter), these &#xA;   Mastrenas seem to have a very small doser so the effect of grind-change &#xA;   is quite rapid. This first pair will be a blend of the old setting and the new. &#xA;   The second pair is most or all fresh ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[n.b This is not official Starbucks policy, but my own private theory developed over the past 10 years of working with this machine (and its predecessor the Verismo). Other Starbucks Baristas should follow this advice only if comfortable with having to explain what you're doing to the other Baristas (and Managers) who may be staring at you wondering what you think you're doing. ]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="959" LastEditorUserId="959" LastEditDate="2016-04-23T06:38:53.180" LastActivityDate="2016-04-23T06:38:53.180" CommentCount="0" />

When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is &quot;clogged&quot; in this way.

Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more &quot;watery&quot; shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article from Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that?

Having used this method for many years now I think it gives consistently good coffee, comparable to that from a good espresso machine but without the need for machinery or paper filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipe:&lt;/strong&gt; Bring one cup's worth of water to a boil in a small pot. Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. &lt;strong&gt;Has anyone else tried it?&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any drawbacks to this method?

All are &quot;natural&quot; brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html&quot;&gt;The Chemex filter page&lt;/a&gt; states that they are &quot;20-30% heavier&quot; than other filters and removes finer sediment and &quot;undesirable oils and fats&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html&quot;&gt;Melitta brand filters&lt;/a&gt; have claimed &quot;flavor enhancing perforations.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method.

I prefer your &quot;slower&quot; pour method over your friend's... read on for why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer story:&#xA;Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html&quot;&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover&quot;&gt;Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; Most agree that water for pour-over should be &lt;strong&gt;just off the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but exact temperature is both difficult to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of &lt;strong&gt;93-97°C / 200-207°F&lt;/strong&gt;. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the &quot;right stuff&quot; from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an &quot;off&quot; taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, &lt;em&gt;I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.&lt;/em&gt; It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of pouring the water.&lt;/strong&gt; This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final &quot;drainage&quot; and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. &lt;strong&gt;I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; at a steady rate.&lt;/strong&gt; The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinsing your filter&lt;/a&gt;, and see more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom&quot;&gt;wetting the grounds for coffee bloom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-07-23T05:06:03.330" LastActivityDate="2015-07-23T05:06:03.330" CommentCount="4" />

In fact, even things that &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;strong&gt;mass-market coffee like this might &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from AeroPress treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robusta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robusta produces &lt;strong&gt;more crema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in espresso, and might be a way to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;more crema from AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;. Robusta also has slightly &lt;strong&gt;more caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Arabica&lt;/em&gt;, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, &lt;strong&gt;you might reduce a bit of the bitterness&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There might be a few problems, though.&lt;/strong&gt; First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like &lt;strong&gt;Maxwell House is rather course&lt;/strong&gt; for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bunn&lt;/a&gt;). Second, if there are other &quot;stuff&quot; in the coffee (e.g., &quot;Folgers Crystals&quot; or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-07-24T14:29:45.157" CommentCount="1" />

If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a &lt;em&gt;gas&lt;/em&gt; flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your &quot;mileage&quot; may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more &quot;DIY&quot; adventure as you suggest, &lt;strong&gt;consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source&lt;/strong&gt;. Other styles of vac-pot (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000IKLQY6&quot;&gt;this Hario model - c/o Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/siphon&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/vacuum-pot&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;, and many others).

If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this.

Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their &quot;espresso&quot; blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and &quot;highest end products&quot; are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced &quot;good enough for everyone&quot; standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.  The most notable aspect being their branding strategies and tactics.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2015-07-29T16:13:26.387" CommentCount="2" />

Not all of the coffees are organic, but there are efforts underway throughout the world to reinvest in the farms and communities, etc etc. I'm sure there are specific priorities in each area, and going (California-certified) organic is not necessarily the highest. Education, clean water, economic concerns could each be more significant to a specific area (just speculating, and rationalizing; but it's all reasonable, right?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some stuff is more artificial. &lt;del&gt;The pumpkin sauce.&lt;/del&gt; (They fixed the Pumpkin Sauce.)

You just need more-than-normal amount of water and short black (single or double dose or shot). This coffee will have less caffeine than the above coffee types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto&quot;&gt;Ristretto&lt;/a&gt; is more of the opposite of Lungo. It uses regular ground coffee with less-than-normal amount of water:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso coffee made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with about half the amount of water...  The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically double the shot volume. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also Italian and literally the opposite of a Lungo. It also has less caffeine than American or espresso since it only uses a short shot of espresso and regular ground coffee, similar to Lungo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, American and espresso have the highest caffeine content out of the four, and Lungo and Ristrtto have less caffeine than the above.

To start, let's explain the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Brewing_process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso is the key to this whole discussion. Each of the four beverages you referenced is (or contains) Espresso. Espresso is a method of brewing coffee, by which pressurized water is passed through a compacted &quot;puck&quot; of fine grounds. In a traditional espresso shot, roughly 0.25 oz of grounds are used to create about 0.85 oz of Espresso. Caffeine levels vary depending on the coffee beans, but as a mainstream reference, Espresso made by Starbucks contains &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;approximately 75mg&lt;/a&gt; (they use slightly different measurements, however).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ristretto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ristretto is a form of Espresso in which &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; water is used. So you take the same puck of 0.25 oz of finely ground coffee, but instead of making 0.9 oz of Espresso, you make a &lt;em&gt;more concentrated&lt;/em&gt; 0.5 oz (or so). Because the strongest Espresso is the first to be brewed, this is &lt;strong&gt;the most concentrated form of espresso&lt;/strong&gt;, and as such has the most caffeine &lt;em&gt;per ounce&lt;/em&gt; of any drink on this list. That said, one shot of Ristretto is is less caffeinated than one shot of Espresso simply because there's less of it. As such, if measuring by the amount of caffeine per shot, this is the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; caffeinated drink on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lungo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lungo is the exact opposite of Ristretto. Instead of being an Espresso made with less water, it's an Espresso made with &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the water. As such, a single shot of Lungo has &lt;strong&gt;the most overall caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; of any drink on this list, but is less concentrated than either standard Espresso or Ristretto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Americano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is Espresso with water in it. No, really. A solo Americano has the exact same amount of caffeine as a solo Espresso, however it is watered down, and as such is the least concentrated drink on this list. You could hypothetically make an Americano from Ristretto or Lungo shots instead of standard Espresso, and in doing so make it less or more caffeinated (respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all are made with the same number of shots, the most caffeinated drinks &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lungo&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Espresso / Americano (tied)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ristretto&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most caffeinated drinks &lt;em&gt;per oz&lt;/em&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ristretto&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Espresso&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lungo&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Americano&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1231" LastActivityDate="2015-08-26T17:38:28.457" CommentCount="0" />

It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who&#xA;  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints&#xA;  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia on &quot;Small Beer&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a lightly alcoholic beverage)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://gladwell.com/java-man/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Malcom Gladwell&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrialization–to help “large numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.” Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called “beer soup.” (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: “Heat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.”) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. That’s what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, let’s not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held true–that in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1244" LastActivityDate="2015-08-29T10:28:29.973" CommentCount="0" />

Percolator coffee relies on gravity to move water that's generally boiling (100 degrees) through coffee. The water temperature does make a significant difference because it is possible to burn coffee with water - which is one of the reasons that to many espresso drinkers filter coffee tastes burnt. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind makes a significant difference as well, Espresso coffee is generally ground finer than drip filter coffee which makes for a more intense taste for the volume of liquid. As per Chris' post, roast and been quality makes a difference - although I'd slightly disagree with Chris and say that it's more than a hindrance. The same bean ground for espresso and produced by an espresso machine and then ground for and produced by a drip filter will taste much different - and he's right in saying that it will highlight a really bad bean.

I used small stainless machine screws/nuts to reattach. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's going to have 120v passing through it so make certain it is secure and the terminals are not contacting/energizing any other component like the actual roasting cup or popper case.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do not have thermostat of some type in your element circuit (you almost certainly do) they are readily available online in a large range of temps. I believe mine opens at 210C now; I think it was 180c when I bought it. 210C is pretty hot and the whole popper gets rather hot but it works for me. You need one that resets, not a single use piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008X0Y14A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; are what I used as I have 2 in my desk drawer right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case if you need to reduce the temps you may try thermal compound for CPU fans or a similar substance to increase conductivity and contact area at the thermostat, possibly turning off the element at a lower temp.  If not they clean up easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2)I altered the airflow also by closing some of the vents on the popping chamber, I've forgotten if I did this prior to upping the temps.  Same amount of air through fewer louvers resulted in higher velocities. Mine has louvers on the sides creating a swirling airflow to agitate the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3)I added mass to the bottom of the popping chamber in an attempt to stabilize the overall temps. A few layers of heavy foil tape were enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4)I attached screens (actual window screen pieces) to intakes on bottom of it to stop the chaff from entering and burning on the element. I credit this for the 2 yr of usage I've gotten from this popper. Other elements have burnt open much faster. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) I played with volume of beans to find max I could do without having uneven results. Too much and airflow was insufficient, too few beans seemed to greatly affect the quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In current practice I usually need to manually shake the popper every 20 sec or so up to first crack, from there the dried beans circulate well. I like very dark roasts so I also often restrict airflow somewhat later in the process by pressing the popper into a thick towel.  It is the easiest way I know to alter airflow (and thus temperature) on the fly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was several years ago so memory may be inaccurate. I'm not currently with the popper but can get it if you want more info or pics. I should buy another and better test these methods individually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1319" LastActivityDate="2015-09-14T18:42:37.970" CommentCount="0" />

Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; More thoughts based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2430/262&quot;&gt;a later question&lt;/a&gt;: There's a few other suggestions from recipes like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kinfolk.com/recipe-cardamom-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/try-this-cardamom-coffee-180331&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (somewhat arbitrary top search hits).

However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).

There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; gingerly, which takes lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can also be the bean, some roasts just &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/&quot;&gt;Lavazza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us&quot;&gt;Illy&lt;/a&gt; produce a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder.

Caffeine use does not fit this profile. Its intake does no harm to the individual or to society and its users are not compelled to consume it. Though cessation of regular use may result in symptoms such as headache and lethargy, these are easily and reliably reversed by ingestion of caffeine. Some have argued that continued caffeine use is an attempt to suppress low grade withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness and lethargy. In some moderate users, this is possible; however, in experimental contexts, the phenomenon is too inconsistent to constitute a reliably valid syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current article on point in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/balance/caffeine-myths-and-facts#1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; says that caffeine addiction is a myth, with &quot;some truth to it,&quot; concluding: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This one has some truth to it, depending on what you mean by &quot;addictive.&quot; Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence. But caffeine doesn't threaten your physical, social, or economic health the way addictive drugs do.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a self-styled &quot;Fact Sheet&quot; published by the Johns Hopkins Behavioral Pharm.

Often the heating system is regulated by a PID regulation (Maybe on-off regulation). The machine will heat the water fast to make sure you can get your cup of coffee:) Once the water is heated it will stabilize to the intended temperature. If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans. After a while the temperature is stabilized and you will experience that the coffee is no longer acidic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that the pipes within the machine are not clean. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can test both. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try turning on the machine an hour before making the first cup.

Or just simply add more coffee. &#xA;Although what I think you are really experiencing is a difference in mouth feel. Using a paper filter with certainly give the coffee clarity. Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Extraction versus Time graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think a good starting place is a 1:16 ratio, meaning 1 parts coffee to 16 parts water.

If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm. Obviously you can adjust the schedule according to your own wake time if it's earlier or later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1637" LastEditorUserId="1637" LastEditDate="2015-11-23T22:05:21.947" LastActivityDate="2015-11-23T22:05:21.947" CommentCount="1" />

The total anthocyanin content did not change immediately, but decreased 24% throughout the yoghurt shelf-life. The individual compounds, (+)-catechin (60%), (-)-epicatechin (60%), kaempferol (33%) and quercetin-3-rutinoside (29%) decreased after 24h in the yoghurt made with the strawberry preparation. During the remaining period of storage these compounds increased by 47%, 6%, 4% and 18%, respectively. Pelargonidin-3-glucoside decreased 49% after 28 d. Immediately after the addition of the strawberry preparation to yoghurt, β-lactoglobulin decreased to values lower than the limit of detection and α-lactalbumin by approximately 34%, and was reduced further slowly throughout yoghurt self-life. An immediate interaction between the carrageenan present in the strawberry preparation and β-LG was observed.

They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nestle press release found at &lt;em&gt;www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/good-news-milk-cream-coffee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whichever line of research you choose to follow, it may not really impact your health over much anyway.

In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo&quot;&gt;lungo&lt;/a&gt;.

Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try beans from a &lt;em&gt;different region&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees.

For tiramisu &lt;strong&gt;I tend to prefer a very dark roast&lt;/strong&gt; (French roast, or Italian roast like @Stephie recommended), which I find to be a good complement to rum, but any roast will do. On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;a bit of bright acidity from a lighter-roasted American coffee&lt;/strong&gt; would probably be a great complement for the creaminess. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also seen a coffee liqueur (e.g., Kahlua or Tia Maria) used in part. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-12-16T02:33:39.103" CommentCount="3" />

Finer and you might overextract and result in a bitter brew; too-coarse and the machine won't extract properly or develop any pressure in the bottom chamber.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of water is almost completely determined by the size of the moka pot&lt;/strong&gt;. Fill nearly (but not quite) up to the over-pressure relief valve; looks a bit like a button. The moka pot is made to brew exactly that amount of coffee; no more, no less.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(exactly as you said). Amount of coffee: filled to the top of the funnel, but not tamped.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat: for a gas-flame-burner, as with any pot, matched to pot size is best. &lt;strong&gt;The flame being completely under and within the base is best.&lt;/strong&gt; It should heat quickly, but the flame should not creep around the sides; you want the bottom to be heated only, not the sides and certainly not the top vessel!

For instance, almost all Sumatran coffee is traditionally dark roasted by companies.  However, light roasted Sumatran coffee has a truly unique set of flavors that is fairly distinct from anything else, without light roasting some yourself, you'd be hard pressed (or French pressed if you are into that) to ever find it fresh.

Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snobbery.

I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin &quot;other&quot; coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.

The traditional copper ones are traditional as copper was easier to produce historically. Steel is easier to shape now. So, you can go for steel. An indicator for good thermal capacity is the boiling character of your coffee. If your coffee starts to boil from the edges, then it is possible that the thermal capacity is less than it should be (or the fire is way too strong to brew coffee).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The bottom must be a bit larger than the top.

Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.

Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process). If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine. If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.

I expect that it wont be as good as I want at first. I may make corrections/additions afterwards. I am a native Turkish, drinking kgs of coffee each week and from a coffee addicted family for generations. Therefore, I count myself as a Turkish-coffee hobbyist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cezve&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hand grinder&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hand grinder setting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fincan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Floating Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fire setting for Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet.

So often when you buy beans at a roastery, there is a recommendation regarding which methods are good for these beans &amp;amp; roast. Thus, a random bag of beans I'm looking at suggests they are good for batch-brew, aeropress, pourover and french press, but not for moka of espresso. But because Turkish isn't a big thing in many countries, it's never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May uneducated impression is that Turkish preserves the acidity and keeps bitterness low. Do you guys know what its profile really is?&#xA;Alternatively, maybe there is a way to predict the suitability of particular &#xA;beans for Turkish based on its character compared to other methods.

But, I can answer based on some tradition and history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The coffee beans &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; originated from Yemen in Ottoman Empire. At least, Yemen was a hub. (This fact is even mentioned in folk songs. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrRS9aNJJQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tr.wikisource.org/wiki/Kahve_yemen&amp;#39;den_gelir-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Historically, Robusta beans were not around, yet. Americas were not explored. So, if you want to follow the tradition, stick with African originated Arabica beans. Still, one should note that if you go for the current Turkish commercial ground coffee brands (like Mehmet Efendi, etc.) on the market, most of them include mostly Robusta beans from South America to keep the costs low. This is ugly face of horeca, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(African originated Arabicas are also my personal preference. My favorite is Ethiopian Harar. As far as I experienced, it is even better than Kopi Luwak for Turkish coffee. Also, this may be a hint. Kopi Luwak is known for low acidity. So, low acidity beans were not good for my taste even it was Kopi Luwak. On the other hand, Kopi Luwak was great while brewed with pressure.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For roasting the beans, you generally do not need to burn the beans to eliminate the acidity. So, light roasts are OK for Turkish coffee. Majority of commercial brands prepare City roast and the minority prepare American roast (I think). If you taste burnt flavor in a package, it is clearly over roasted; you must be suspicious about the quality of the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(My personal preference is a bit darker than that. City roast to full city roast.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last words:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, as Turkish coffee is just a brewing method, it is up to the drinkers taste either to add sugar/gum/cinnamon/milk or not, either to use Robusta or Arabica, either to roast light or dark. I mean, if the drinkers find it more delicious, they can boil it up for hours (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%B1rra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It exists!&lt;/a&gt;) before drinking.

Ingesting roasted coffee beans without grinding/brewing them in some manner is quite common.  Many companies sell them specifically to be consumed this way.  Probably the main associated health risk would be caffeine overdose.  However, it's roughly the same as simply drinking far too much coffee.  The main difference being that since coffee (brewed) takes up so much more volume, you are likely to become physically uncomfortable from it before you could get to dangerous levels.  With coffee beans you could likely get to dangerous levels much easier since it would be possible to eat many more beans before experiencing the same &quot;fullness&quot; effect. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2016-01-15T07:05:00.907" CommentCount="0" />

Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of &lt;strong&gt;coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour&lt;/strong&gt;.

When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. &lt;strong&gt;But don't expect too much.&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Arabica Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; coffee beans should have a &quot;fine sweetness&quot;.

In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1502" LastEditorUserId="76" LastEditDate="2016-01-18T16:01:51.910" LastActivityDate="2016-01-18T16:01:51.910" CommentCount="3" />

I can't find it locally though :(&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some science (sorry I lost all the links...): Espresso is defined by making hot water run through tamped ground coffee at around 9 bar pressure. Only then the oils are extracted. The process of extraction generates the crema.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for aeropress, in order to generate 9 bars, the math tells that you have to press it with 294kg (plus some extra bit that I don't know how to calculate...). Let's call it 300. So you need a lever to do that. And you have to make the lever's math work out because you need as close to 9 bar as possible. More or less will not make an espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, what I personally do is this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is NOT &quot;real&quot; espresso, but I think it's the closest thing you can. And definitely the best method for aeropress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last thing: if you don't use a lever, which could actually generate crema (real espresso); don't worry about whether foam is created. It doesn't make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No... this is the last thing: With said, preferred method, timing doesn't matter.

Theoretically no one would consider anything made by Folgers to be a specialty coffee, and anything produced by a small local roaster should probably be considered specialty, but there is a lot of gray area in between.  For instance, some people may consider the bagged beans Starbucks sells to be specialty coffee, others (myself included) would not. Specialty is largely a marketing term like &quot;Cloud&quot; is for computing.  &quot;Cloud&quot; is used ambiguously for private, public, small, large, closed and open platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally I would define specialty coffee as something not produced and sold on a national scale.  Most specialty coffees are not &quot;branded&quot; by a company because they are bought in lots and sold sort of &quot;as is&quot;.  That is, the roaster bought X amount and when they sell through it, it is gone.  This is opposed to a larger company that will always have &quot;Sumatra Special&quot; available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you start talking about roasting with other things, or adding flavors, you have moved to &quot;flavored&quot; coffee, which I personally would never consider specialty coffee.

You can have beans that come from the same lot differ widely even in processing.  There is no &quot;perfect area&quot; to grow coffee and good coffee can be grown in a fairly well defined, but still variable conditions.

Ristretto styled shots range somewhere in the 1:1 to 1:1.5 range (arguably). For example if you put in 18 grams of coffee, and then yield out 20 grams of espresso (1:1.1)- then you are somewhere in the land of ristretto. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean as far as caffeine goes?

We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump.

They are a bit different, and I use both the metal disk and paper filter based on my mood. To my taste, &lt;strong&gt;the metal disk does produce a &quot;fuller&quot; bodied cup&lt;/strong&gt; (because more &quot;stuff&quot; comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that &quot;an average user&quot; (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I prefer the paper for a few reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;simple convenience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for my (personal) taste and preferences, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of &quot;sludge&quot; in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) &quot;health&quot; reasons.

The particles should appear somewhere between coarse&#xA;  salt and steelcut oats. Take note of your grind size so you can make&#xA;  adjustments later: grind a little finer next time if your brew was&#xA;  weak, a bit coarser if you're tasting a lot of unpleasant, dish-raggy,&#xA;  overextracted flavors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much:&lt;/strong&gt; While there's a maximum amount that your French press will make, there isn't really a minimum. A good coffee-to-water ratio&#xA;  is between 60-70 grams of coffee per liter of water (a mass ratio&#xA;  between 1:16 and 1:14). Decide how much brewed coffee you want to make&#xA;  and weigh out the right amount of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. With French press, you're good to pour your water right off the boil unless&#xA;  you've got an insulated (or double-walled) press, in which case you&#xA;  should wait about 30 seconds off of boil. If you're brewing&#xA;  dark-roasted coffee or decaf, it's better with water about 10 to 15°F&#xA;  lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your clock and add your water. Some people like to add a little water, stir, and add the rest. It really doesn't matter. The&#xA;  important part is what you do after you add the water. If you were to&#xA;  just sit back and wait out your brew time now, you'd have an&#xA;  under-extracted brew, because the release of CO2 gas will cause your&#xA;  grounds to rise up and float on top of your water. Remember that first&#xA;  phase &quot;Wetting?&quot; Well, if you don't have good wetting, you don't have&#xA;  much of anything that follows, so you should give your coffee and&#xA;  water mix a gentle but thorough stir at about 30 to 45 seconds in.&#xA;  You'll know you're good to put the lid on and move on to the next step&#xA;  when most of the coffee has sunk and isn't floating anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be very different from what you've heard before, but bear with me: shoot for a target brew time between &lt;strong&gt;6 and 8 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;What?&#xA;  I thought it was 3 to 4 minutes!&quot; you might say. You can brew in 3 to&#xA;  4 minutes if you want, but to get good flavor results, you'd be&#xA;  grinding a lot finer, and you're not getting the most out of the&#xA;  unique qualities of the French press. Give 6 to 8 minutes a try with&#xA;  the coarse grind, and see if you can dial that in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're ready to stop your brewing, it's time to plunge. So as I've mentioned, French press is a nice, slow, gentle brew. One great&#xA;  way to ruin that niceness would be to violently agitate your coffee&#xA;  grounds, accelerating extraction right at the end when your coffee has&#xA;  already given up the good stuff and the bitter and astringent negative&#xA;  flavors are in danger of taking over. Plunge gently. If you feel the&#xA;  plunger start to get tight, back it up an inch or two and resume&#xA;  plunging. Once you get to the bottom, you're done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've plunged your bed down nice and tight, there isn't a lot of brewing that will happen from this point on, but it's still ideal&#xA;  to pour off your entire beverage right after plunging to truly stop&#xA;  the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2094" LastActivityDate="2016-02-12T17:04:19.430" CommentCount="0" />

Discovered by a French chemist in 1910 the MRx is what is largely responsible for transforming the mere handful of compounds found in green coffee (unroasted) to the complex aromatic beverage that it is today. As temperatures reach 150°C (302°F) the MRx causes free proteins to combine with sugars to form aromatic compounds such as furans which impart sweet, caramel like notes to the coffee. &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More on this chemical reaction  here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coffeechemistry.com/library/coffee-science-publications/unlocking-coffee-s-chemical-composition-part-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.coffeechemistry.com/library/coffee-science-publications/unlocking-coffee-s-chemical-composition-part-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember.

I myself measured the &quot;very hot&quot; water taps from a filter machine and from a hot water dispenser in my office: one was 75°C and one was 85°C. The latter is actually the hot water dispenser from a coffee-brewing machine. Both of these are way below what I consider to be adequate brewing temperature (~95°C).

In brewing; water temperature, length of contact with the grinds, and fineness of ground are the main factors you can control to keep bitterness to a minimum.  Here are a few explanations that might help:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotter water will dissolve all the compounds more quickly, including the bitter ones.  Make sure your water is &quot;off the boil&quot;, meaning somewhere between 195-205F.  This will mean the bitter notes will dissolve into the brew more slowly.  This is good.  Along these lines, one thing I've discovered is that using less water means the grounds will cool off the water more and they can steep for longer without producing bitterness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finer ground means more of the bitter compounds are in direct contact with the water so a slightly more coarse grind can reduce bitterness as well, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer hot water is in contact with the grounds, the more the bitterness will come out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question directly, just splitting your batch won't help without one of these modifications.  Without seeing your method directly I would offer these suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take care with your water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider only pouring a portion of the water over the grounds, like maybe half, to two thirds, then just pouring the rest of the water into the concentrated coffee.  Less water through the coffee.  This is essentially how an AeroPress works.  When I've brewed the same coffee with an AeroPress vs. pour over, the pour over definitely comes out more bitter when I pour all the water through the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try a coarser grind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try a combination of these, such as a slightly coarser grind, pouring only 2/3 of the water through, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I haven't mentioned is to make sure you're using good coffee beans, not roasted too dark.

When&#xA;  roasting is completed the chaff falls off and is removed from the&#xA;  roaster. Like coffee, chaff contains a high nitrogen content which&#xA;  makes it a valuable product for environmental purposes, and each roast&#xA;  produces about 3.2 pounds of chaff. As part of our commitment to&#xA;  consciously great coffee we have found a way to recycle the chaff from&#xA;  every roast instead of tossing it into the dumpster. Since 2008 we&#xA;  have partnered with a company called Reconserve that converts bulk&#xA;  food waste materials into animal feed and who’s guiding philosophy is:&#xA;  recycle, reprocess, resource conservation. Reconserve picks the chaff&#xA;  up from our roasting facility in Sacramento, blends it with other&#xA;  bakery byproducts, and produces a feed supplement for dairy cows. We&#xA;  currently produce about 4,000 pounds of chaff each month, this means&#xA;  since 2008 we have recycled about 320,000 pounds of chaff into feed&#xA;  for cattle. We take our commitment to sustainability seriously and&#xA;  make sure that we are constantly evaluating every step of our process&#xA;  to see where we can make improvements.

This made for more bitter coffee, because the coffee was over extracted, and it pulled the tannins into solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We opted for simply letting the coffee brew longer and increasing pressure during the press to force extract more out of the grounds. This yielded a much stronger concentrate that we'd then dilute to normal coffee/water proportions. This created a delicious and full cup of coffee every time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think for your case, you'd be brewing hours apart with the same grounds to save money, and I think you totally could. The issue I see is that most caffeine in coffee is extracted within seconds of brew time, so your second brew with those grounds may not yield a nicely drugged cup of joe. So not only will the taste be bitter, but it may also put you to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="362" LastActivityDate="2016-03-09T00:41:35.897" CommentCount="0" />

Doing a cold brew I find is amazing for dark roasts, because it subdues the acids, and the dark chocolate/woody flavors don't work as well with a lot of acids in my opinion. I believe an espresso brings out maximum acidity/brightness for any given coffee, and you get a lot of citrus notes, but that might be too bright to taste the sweet flavors you're looking for. That means you want something in the middle just erring on the side of bright. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend this: find a Panama (or other central/south American origin) dry-processed (aka &quot;natural&quot;) and brew it with gentle pressure for sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dry-processed/Natural coffees are dried out with fruit flesh on before its removal, which allows the sweetness and flavor of cascara fruit seep into the beans. Washed/Wet-processed coffees have their fruit flesh removed immediately, so they tend to have a cleaner coffee flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="362" LastEditorUserId="362" LastEditDate="2016-03-15T20:05:28.263" LastActivityDate="2016-03-15T20:05:28.263" CommentCount="0" />

Sugar is also used; it is very similar to searing something on a pan so there is no exact way to measure what % of the ingredients you used will be &quot;absorbed&quot; into the beans. The oil here is used to glaze the beans, which would then mix consistently when ground and brewed. I would refer to this answer similarly asked under &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17987/how-to-butter-roast-coffee-in-frying-pan&quot;&gt;Cooking-Exchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;....The... beans are generally roasted in what is referred to as &quot;butter oil&quot;, which may or may not be actual clarified butter oil. Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional &quot;home-grown&quot; coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vietnamese-coffee.com/vietnamese_coffee_about.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here you will find more information&lt;/a&gt; on how the technique for the beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope helps answer your question&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2118" LastActivityDate="2016-03-16T15:49:00.393" CommentCount="2" />

They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear &quot;Ethiopian arabica&quot; or &quot;Indonesian robusta&quot; quite often.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Roast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there are also unlisted very very light roasts as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/how-to-create-green-coffee&quot;&gt;green coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The grind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grinding is also closely related to the targeted drink. For example, the coffee must be as fine as powder for preparing Turkish coffee. On the other hand, such fine grinding is so unpractical in French press as the grains could easily travel through the filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Choose a brewing method. As a subtitle, use proper equipment for that method. Master your brewing method. Needless to say, there are (probably) hundreds of them. I could enlist three main methods as: pressurized extraction, thermal extraction, and cold-brew methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to a questionnaire, baristas in Italy state that even pouring the espresso may affect the flavor. Apart from that, it is a known fact that the espresso cups must be pre-heated for a better experience. So, even serving the coffee is important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus article to the aforementioned ones, freshness. One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: &lt;em&gt;the customer not the espresso must wait&lt;/em&gt;. In one experiment it is shown that, if one day old ground coffee is used, the foam volume of espresso is 35% less than the one prepared by freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastActivityDate="2016-03-26T20:02:10.017" CommentCount="0" />

Normally, it is ideal to fill up the cezve up to one third to the half of its height before beginning the brewing process. You need the rest of the height during the foaming time. You cannot fill it up to the neck and start brewing. In that case, at the end, when bubbles start to appear, it will spill over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Turkey, cezve is usually sold in sets. You can see a set of old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves in the image below. This set includes 1-cup to 5-cup cezves. However, I don't recommend them as the metal is not thick, so the heat is not homogeneously distributed while brewing. A second disadvantage is, tin plating could be worn away in time and copper oxidizes easily. The green colored copper-oxide is quite poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A modern stainless steel cezve set is also shown below. (Image is copied from Hisar cutlery firm's website.) This set includes 2-cup to 4-cup cezves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/K9on3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/K9on3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, both sets include different sized cezves for different servings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A distinct advantage of possessing more than one cezve at home has another advantage: You may prepare Turkish coffee with or without sugar at the same time in two different cezves in case your guest wants to consume a different recipe than yours.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I assume I make my point that the size matters and also the count is important. Let's talk about the shape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be practical, see inside. Check the spoon for stirring in the second image. You can see its length is ideal for stirring without burning your hand. Your hand will be over the vaporizing coffee most of the time. Find your ideal spoon, together with your cezve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it can clearly be seen, the shape is more or less the same. Wider bottom is mostly a result of finding proper balance on top of the stoves for small sized ones. You can see it when you look at them in the sets next to each other. If the bottom is wider, the neck seems narrower. When you have heavier stainless steel cezves, balance is already there, so the bottom is not that wider, thus the neck is not that narrower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I must admit that, a narrow neck is also related with the foam. The foam is formed by carbon dioxide packed in coffee lipids. When you heat the coffee, the carbon dioxide is extracted together with lipids and cannot be solved after some threshold in water. Those carbon dioxide changes its phase to gas form such as any effervescent, forming bubbles. This is the foam of Turkish coffee. If you try to brew Turkish coffee in a pan, the bubbles will be too far away and cannot survive in the surface of the coffee. They will soon pop and fade away. If they are close together, some irregularities of coffee (such as small particles in the coffee powder) stick on the surface of the bubbles and keep them together. Then, the bubbles form the foam. That's the reason a narrow neck helps to keep the foam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastActivityDate="2016-03-27T18:54:10.010" CommentCount="0" />

The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this brings us to the coffee portion.

Caffeine alone is very effective at perking a person up but if paired with sugar this can have a double &quot;energy effect since the sugar will also increase energy levels...but sugar will also cause a &quot;sugar crash&quot; (that is another topic, regarding insulin/glucose levels in the blood.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So lets say you don't drink large doses of caffeine on a regular basis and you want to try and drink this famous &quot;cup of Joe&quot; from Starbucks, what could go wrong? well it all depends on your caffeine tolerance. Just like a habitual user of nicotine or other stimulating drugs will be affected differently, a caffein user will tolerate different levels of a cup of joe depending on their weight, liver function to metabolize the caffeine and how much water you drink + kidney function. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a drug:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is no more different than nicotine or cocaine, Why? because caffeine is considered a stimulant very much like nicotine and cocaine, it produces very similar effects thus some of the side effects may be similar as well. Also, caffeine is habit forming and a person can become dependent or addicted to it, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when coming off it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.[10] It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but — unlike many other psychoactive substances — it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a sedative. Immediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a &quot;kick&quot; caused in part by the drug's stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body, causing a sudden release of glucose as well as an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, causing smokers to be slightly hyperglycemic. In addition, nicotine indirectly causes a release of dopamine in the brain regions that control pleasure and motivation.

The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be other ways, but I have no other experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Later...&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to &quot;drip-brew&quot;, so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results.

There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents &lt;strong&gt;channelling&lt;/strong&gt;, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Change your beans.

But they have partially been given a bad rep by large chains who are using them to maximize profit, and not flavor.  Home and microroasters now also have unprecedented access to a HUGE variety of beans that years back would have been out of reach.  This means that companies can cheaply distribute very high quality beans with extraordinary flavor profiles when roasted at a lighter level.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2016-04-16T01:44:49.527" CommentCount="2" />

The Poppery 2 is easier and roasts larger batches but I haven't really dialed in the method as well as the Air Crazy. The Poppery 2 shows great potential and I'd recommend an old one bought on ebay for any beginner. $20 or so and it roasts 2-3 days worth for my 3 person household per batch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commercially produced home roasters can run $200-500. You gain automation and maybe consistency for that price though. I've been so happy with the air poppers I've never bought a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;---Side note about air roasting (in poppers at least)- it definitely doesn't produce a homogenous roast for me when using blends. I've spent a lot of time watching the beans while roasting and I attribute this to varying size, density and moisture in the varietals used in the mix. Even single source coffees may vary in these characteristics to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1319" LastActivityDate="2016-04-22T06:09:08.957" CommentCount="0" />

There are something like a hundred different species, with Robusta and Arabica being the most common commercially grown by far.  Liberica is another species that is grown in small quantities and has a very distinctive taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within a single species such as Arabica, there can be a huge number of varietals. Some are naturally occuring (such as Bourbon and Typica). Maragogype (&quot;elephant bean&quot;) is also a naturally occuring mutation from Brazil. Others have been bred by research institutes. For example SL-28 and SL-34 are common Kenyan varietals. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another famous varietal is the &quot;Gesha&quot; (sometimes romantically but incorrectly called &quot;Geisha&quot;). This came to light when an estate in Pananma &quot;La Esmarelda&quot; noted something interesting when they were cupping their coffee. By separating their harvest, they finally identified a small section which was contributing to the overall cup. This coffee went on to dominate the Cup of Excellence competition and set a world record price at the time. It's since been planted on other farms which brings up the next point.....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned, things like altitude, soil and micro-climate affect the taste. So the Gesha (or any other) varietal from one farm won't taste exactly the same as Gesha from another farm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way of preparing the green beans - washed, dry-processed, or a number of other methods, all have their effect on the final flavour. So even the identical cultivar harvested from the same farm but prepared differently will produce different flavours. (The difference between dry and wet-processed is very signficant.) The actual care taken during preparation is also hugely important - I suspect that if one is starting out with a decent high grown bean, this is what really separates speciality coffee from the mass produced stuff. It takes a lot more care to prep the coffee carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I haven't even mentioned roasting and brewing....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is what makes coffee so interesting - there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; so much variety to try and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2367" LastActivityDate="2016-04-26T11:17:31.223" CommentCount="1" />

A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Misc Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be blending stuff, get a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; blender that can eat through ice easily.

Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Water&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water.

Got a place that delivers it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad.

It requires very little equipment.  It is basically a manual process of letting the coffee cherries raisin up, then peeling them.  It is a labor intensive process.  Dry processing tends to produce body heavy, smooth coffees with complex notes.  Dry processing is used extensively in Brazil and accounts for the distinct different flavor profiles from other South American coffees.  Dry processing is not practical in humid, wet, or temperate areas, as dry heat is necessary to dry the fruit in a short enough amount of time and to assure that mold or fungus does not set in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wet Process | This method start with running the cherries through machinery to remove the skin and outer layers of the fruit.  The beans with remaining inner layers of fruit are soaked in water and allowed to ferment.  Additional processing is done  to remove the final inner layers surrounding the bean.  The result is left to dry (usually with additional machine assistance).  Wet processing requires a comparatively large investment in equipment, access to enough water for the process and creates waste water that must also be dealt with.  The process does allow for multiple areas to sort beans (floating during fermentation, in channel after fruit strip, etc) that potentially allow for a more uniform product.  Wet processed coffees tend to be missing the overt fruit notes of a dry process, but this is debatable and can vary based on fermentation methods (additional additives are sometimes used in the fermenting process).  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Semi-Dry / Pulped Natural / Wet Hulled / Semi-Washed | This process is similar to the wet process except the fermentation step is skipped and specialized machines are used to strip the final layers from around the bean.  This method can produce beans with the best of both processing methods, but the machines used to strip the inner layers away are also prone to damaging beans.  This is a faster method of processing but again requires machine investment and resource use.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="76" LastEditDate="2016-04-27T19:00:10.940" LastActivityDate="2016-04-27T19:00:10.940" CommentCount="0" />

From what I could gather, there are two points here, one theoretical and one empiric.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, caffeine is one of the fastest-extracting compounds in coffee, such that it is extracted almost immediately, so, logically, the amount of caffeine in a brew would only be determined by the amount of beans that go into it and not the brewing method. Which means that whatever comes out of the AeroPress could not possibly have that much more caffeine than other methods. Particularly, not significantly more than an espresso shot, since the amounts of coffee used are about the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My own experience, however, suggests otherwise.&#xA;When I first got my AeroPress, I (naturally) brewed some coffee with it. Upon drinking just half of the brew, I got a kick stronger than after anything I'd ever consumed before. Several days later I hosted a party where I served AeroPress coffee, and about two thirds of the guests separately noted that the coffee was unusually strong. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solving this contradiction seems pretty hard. Right now I see several (not entirely exclusive) possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;first, that AeroPress brew really does have a significantly higher caffeine content. &#xA;&lt;em&gt;Pretty unlikely, but the possibility is nonzero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;second, that AeroPress brew contains high concentrations of some non-caffeine compounds, which:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;are produced  in significantly lower quantities with other brewing methods, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strongly contribute to the typical effects of consuming lots of coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don't know how likely this is, since I'm not aware of whether caffeine is the only major contributor to the effects of coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;finally, that it is mainly a placebo-like psychological effect.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Also unlikely, since the guests at the party probably did not have any prior preconceptions about AeroPress coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line: coffee from the AeroPress does tend to be perceived as stronger than average by a variety of people (including stronger after-coffee effects), but caffeine might not be the reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1922" LastEditorUserId="1922" LastEditDate="2016-05-07T11:23:17.037" LastActivityDate="2016-05-07T11:23:17.037" CommentCount="3" />

If it's bitter, it's over extracted. Now this does not mean there will not be any sour or bitter notes in the coffee. There will be but it needs to be balanced.&#xA;The roasting of the coffee plays an important role too. Some coffees are roasted for far too long and they come out tasting bitter. This is usually the case when the roaster is either inexperienced or is trying to cover up poor quality beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To adjust extraction, you can adjust temperature, grind size and brewing method. Some like drip causes the water to flow over the the grounds at rate that's proportional to the flow of water into the drip brewer (like Hario V60) and the size of grinds. Some others, like Aeropress, lets the grinds steep in the water with a little bit of agitation. You need to pick one method that you're comfortable with, then adjust the parameters for that brew method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can try increasing and reducing water temperature too.&#xA;So how will you know you got a good cup? Taste it. When you start to taste flavours that you've never encountered with that coffee before, you know you're heading in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.

Thus you have a lot of aroma, but the overall aroma will be a bit burnt and bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I realized that @Geo already explained the Maillard reaction very neatly in a previous answer &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/quantifying-flavor-differences-between-varieties/2550#2550&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-05-13T20:21:38.333" LastActivityDate="2016-05-13T20:21:38.333" CommentCount="3" />

In theory, it is possible to super-heat any liquid with polar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature of an object is defined by the total kinetic energy of its molecules. The kinetic energy has two sources, the linear velocity of molecules, and spin of molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microwave ovens heat up objects by adding &lt;em&gt;spin&lt;/em&gt; to the molecules of an object. Roughly speaking, molecules stay where they are, but spin around very rapidly under microwave to heat up. &lt;em&gt;During this phase, they cannot find a way to vaporize (linear velocity).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When your friend take the cup out of the oven, the molecules are not under the effect of microwave (so they don't spin) anymore, so they find their way out to vaporize, and choose to vaporize (linear velocity) very quickly. That occurs as an explosion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastActivityDate="2016-05-12T12:27:38.133" CommentCount="0" />

I came across an experiment (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/reviews/titan-grinder-project-particle-size-distributions-of-ground-coffee-t4203.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that showed the coffee particle size after put in water in the grinder was about 10 micron (in diameter) on average. This seemed dubious to me and the posting hasn't been responsive in 9 years so I was wondering if anyone knows if this is reasonable and if you have any recomendation for coffee grinders that produce a low particle size?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2708" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T02:29:44.530" Title="Size of Coffee Ground Particle" Tags="&lt;ground-coffee&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="0" />
