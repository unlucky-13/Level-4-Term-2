I answered the wrong sub-question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The harder case is for a non-parent to get custody from a parent: for one parent to prevail over the other given such a choice of environment would probably not be difficult (depending on the details of the alternative custody). In Washington state, &lt;a href=&quot;http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.10&amp;amp;full=true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RCW 26.10&lt;/a&gt; is the chapter under which one would petition for non-parental custody. The statute is stunningly under-informative in terms of what counts: 26.10.100 simply says &quot;The court shall determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child&quot;. However, it is a possibility (which does not exist in all states).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To win the case over the parent's objection, one must either establish that the parent is unfit, or placing / leaving the child with that parent would have a negative effect – &quot;being better&quot; is not good enough. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leagle.com/decision/199533877WnApp261_1311/MATTER%20OF%20CUSTODY%20OF%20ANDERSON&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In re the Custody of Anderson, 77 Wn. App. 261&lt;/a&gt; seems to a first piece of required reading on the topic (in this case, the mother retained custody, so it gives you an idea where the bar is). I don't know the final outcome of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leagle.com/decision/198941256WnApp356_1367/IN%20THE%20MATTER%20OF%20CUSTODY%20OF%20STELL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In re Stell, 56 Wn.App. 356&lt;/a&gt;, but in this case the aunt at least got to legal first base. In Stell, the court said&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;RCW 26.10.100 must be read to require more than the usual &quot;best&#xA;  interests&quot; test. Thus, the trial court ruled that a parent has a&#xA;  priority right to custody &quot;unless the parent is either unfit or&#xA;  placement of the child with the parent would detrimentally effect&#xA;  [sic] the child's growth and development&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;citing &lt;a href=&quot;http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/028wnapp/028wnapp0637.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In re Marriage of Allen, 28 Wn.App. 637&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;The custody of the child may be awarded to the nonparent only upon a showing that the parent is unfit or that the child's growth and development would be detrimentally affected by placement with an otherwise fit parent&quot;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/041wnapp/041wnapp0444.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chapman v. Perera, 41 Wn.App. 444&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;giving custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child&quot;). The crux of Stell is that the father was found to not be doing a good enough job of parenting, and the psychologist's testimony supported the aunt getting custody. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In these cases, nothing involved drug convictions or violent crimes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://courts.mrsc.org/supreme/153wn2d/153wn2d0646.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In re the Custody of Brown 153 Wn.2d 646&lt;/a&gt; adds something on that front. The paternal grandmother Luby was taking care of the child (the parents had drug problems), but then Luby got busted for growing a respectable amount of marijuana, and did 30 days. The maternal grandmother Sherman subsequently witnessed a number of adults smoking the at-the-time illegal weed (2005), and now we have two competitors for non-parental custody. The trial court determined that Luby's household was a &quot;threat to the child's well-being and continued exposure to the regular use of marijuana and abuse of alcohol is detrimental to the child&quot; (this was upheld to the highest levels). This adds drug use in the home, but does not involve terminating a parent's custody, which is harder to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the third or fourth hand, moving into a house occupied by people convicted of drug and violent crimes is not &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; deleterious to a child's upbringing. The obvious question would be whether the people had paid their debt to society and were now virtuous, or were still engaged in bad behavior. There isn't any legal precedent in Washington for saying that moving into a house inhabited by reformed criminals is itself a harmful environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4501" LastActivityDate="2016-08-17T00:56:44.920" CommentCount="0" />

Now I could end up paying a very high amount for low priced goods, which is ridiculous. Example, I will now pay around 75% of the value of an order. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is because you should either pay to the Post Office to represent you or have an electronic signature. In addition, if you pay to the Post Office, it can't happen the same day. And you should either go (in another day, when the procedure is done) to the customs yourself, or pay them additional delivery fee, which is higher than the fee of all other courier services. In addition, you should also pay some administrative fee to the customs and, of course, 20% VAT. So the price grows ridiculously large, especially for low priced goods and could end up at about 100% of the goods value. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am wondering - how is this regulated in other EU countries and also how and where can I dispute this official regulation/procedure? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And while I understand what is the purpose of that - to stimulate consumption of local goods, this just won't happen - what I purchase from abroad is usually something I can't locally or is ridiculously overpriced.

Additionally, it meets the definition of hearsay because the Declarant (the defendant) was not currently testifying and it is presumably being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the statement of a defendant is generaly exempted from the definition of hearsay when a plaintiff is using it against the defendant under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fed.

If the prosecutor knew what answer was forthcoming, then it may be some form of misconduct and how serious depends on a number of factors like intent and history of the prosecutor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the more important question is what remedy are you seeking?

If the witness was aware of the court's ruling on the motion to exclude, then the witness should not have answered and could have asked for a clarification from the judge (outside the presence of the jury) whether the witness can answer the question. The witness could have turned to the judge and said &quot;Your honor, I am not sure how to answer that question within in the confines of your previous rulings.&quot;  The judge would like excuse the jury and the lawyers and judges can confer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8830" LastEditorUserId="8830" LastEditDate="2016-08-18T19:41:44.073" LastActivityDate="2016-08-18T19:41:44.073" CommentCount="2" />

Anyone can always be sued for anything. If the kid jumps badly, lands on your property, gets hurt, they might have a case or the judge might see it your way.

As a property owner you CAN be held liable for anything that happens on your property. Including someone trespassing onto your property without your permission, even to commit crimes, and hurting themselves in the process.  Many court cases have ruled in favor of the law-abiding landowner, but that's not to say there is a guarantee of this.

European law relies on more pervasive regulation, but much more difficult civil remedies in terms of both damages and discovery.  In theory, the American perspective should result in a more just outcome on an individual basis because each case is judged on the facts of that case with more extensive discovery to determine the wrong and higher damages to punish the wrong-doers and put plaintiffs back in their rightful position, but the European perspective can head off more wrongs before they occur and promote more certainty for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although in an individual case basis, American law offers higher recoveries, it is hard to tell what promotes more responsible action by potential defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8830" LastActivityDate="2016-08-19T22:26:19.090" CommentCount="0" />

It reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 74.01(1)(c) of the Competition Act is a civil provision. It prohibits the making, or the permitting of the making, to the public, of any materially &lt;strong&gt;misleading&lt;/strong&gt; product warranty or guarantee, or promise to replace, maintain or repair an article. This includes circumstances in which there is no reasonable &lt;strong&gt;prospect that the warranty, guarantee or promise will be carried out&lt;/strong&gt;. Under this provision, it is not necessary to demonstrate that any person was &lt;strong&gt;deceived or misled&lt;/strong&gt;; that any member of the public to whom the representation was made was within Canada; or that the representation was made in a place to which the public had access. Subsection 74.03(5) directs that the &lt;strong&gt;general impression&lt;/strong&gt; conveyed by a representation, as well as its literal meaning, be taken into account when determining whether or not the representation is false or misleading in a material respect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If a court determines that a person has engaged in conduct contrary to paragraph 74.01(1)(c), it may order the person not to engage in such &lt;strong&gt;conduct&lt;/strong&gt;, to publish a corrective notice and/or to pay an &lt;strong&gt;administrative monetary penalty&lt;/strong&gt; of up to $750,000 in the case of a first time occurrence by an individual and $10,000,000 in the case of a first time occurrence by a corporation. For subsequent orders, the penalties increase to a maximum of $1,000,000 in the case of an individual and $15,000,000 in the case of a corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've added all bold items in this paragraph for subjects of importance.

I appreciate your taking the time to look at this important issue I am trying to find a solution to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I signed a 1 year lease almost a year ago for the residence I just left.  The lease indicated that if I intend to end the lease early I must give a 60 day notice to the Landlord, in writing, before I can leave and that I would be responsible for any/all rent not collected by a potential new tenant should they be unable to find one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had received a letter indicating that my lease was about to expire, some time before the 60 day cut-off point (but not by much) that indicated I had three options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Renew the lease and pay another $10/month for the new lease.&#xA;2) Go onto month-to-month for an extra $35/month.&#xA;3) Move out before the lease expires.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Number 2 was the option I was going to take since I was in the middle of looking for a new job out of town, and thus, planning to find a new place to live when that happened, but I never actually chose that option because the letter indicated that would be what automatically happened if I didn't return the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, I accepted a job 3 weeks before my lease expires, found an apartment and moved to that apartment at great cost in money and time.  My landlord got wind of this, called me, and told me I never gave a 60 day notice, so I politely indicated to them that according to my research, Wisconsin law indicates I only need to give a 28 day notice if I am on month to month, so I told them they would be getting a written notice at the beginning of next month to coincide with that 28 day notice, versus their ridiculous 60 day notice requirement for being on the lease.  The reason I did this is because I didn't want to be on the hook for potentially 2 more months of rent, since I do not trust my landlord to fill the vacancy quickly when I am gone.  My landlord told me that I &quot;have it all wrong&quot; that despite being on month-to-month I am still on lease and that I am to be held to the 60 day notice regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For your reference, what I am referring to as my &quot;research&quot; is the following information:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Notice Requirements for Wisconsin Tenants&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is equally easy for tenants in Wisconsin to get out of a month-to-month rental agreement.  You must provide the same amount of notice (28 days) as the landlord (unless your rental agreement provides for a shorter amount of notice).  Be sure to check your rental agreement which may require that your notice to end the tenancy be given on the first of the month or on another specific date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In some situations, you may be able to move out with less (or no) notice—for example, if your landlord seriously violates the rental agreement or fails to fulfill legal responsibilities affecting your health or safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That information can be found here, and on a few different websites: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/wisconsin-notice-requirements-terminate-month-month-tenancy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wisconsin Notice Requirements to Terminate Month to Month Tenancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my question is, am I allowed to give my 28 day notice at the end of this month/beginning of this month and not be held accountable for the month after?  I do know I will have to pay this coming month's rent (+$35 for the month-to-month agreement) and that I am still responsible for utilities during that time as well, but I do not believe according to the information I provided here that I will be held responsible for the month after next (October) and that my landlord is basically trying to con me out of another month of rent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please advise; I am certainly thankful for anyone taking the time to research this for me.

In a common law jurisdiction such decisions are &lt;a href=&quot;http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/binding-precedent/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;binding&lt;/a&gt; on lower courts in the same jurisdictional hierarchy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/persuasive-precedent/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;persuasive&lt;/a&gt; on the same level and higher courts and foreign courts. In the US foreign courts normally means courts in other US states that lack a binding precedent on the matter but courts can look to decisions in other common law countries like Canada, Australia, the UK etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because courts interpret the &quot;common law&quot; their judgments usually reflect (in some way) community expectations. However, judicial systems are, by their nature, slow to change and while they track community expectations they do so with a time lag, say 20-30 years: the lag in time between when the judges making decisions now had their views on society fixed during their college years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Judicial law, in theory, stretches back to Anglo-Norman law with decisions building on (and occasionally knocking over) what has come before. In practice, this chain has usually been severed at some point (usually more than once) by the intervention of the legislature to correct what they saw as a &quot;failure&quot; in the common law. Subsequent common law builds on that statute like barnacles on a ship's hull (but without the negative connotation ... maybe).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By your terminology, such laws are almost always descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Administrative Law&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the law created by the administrative arm of government using the powers explicitly granted by the relevant constitution, delegated by the legislature or derived from common law powers. For example, if a statute authorizes the levying of taxes on the value of real estate, it is usually left to the administrative branch to determine how to collect and use the data needed to arrive at a given property's value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By your terminology, such laws can go either way. Establishing the land tax system example would be prescriptive, modifying it to match changing social circumstances would be descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Legislative Law&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Legislative or statute law is the laws passed by the legislature by whatever name that is known. They can only make laws within the bounds permitted by their constitutions but within those limits they are free to do whatever they choose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the laws they pass are simply to enable the other parts of government to get on with their jobs - like giving them the money to pay the army or the judges or whatever. I guess these would be descriptive - of course, passing a law to say you can't pay the army would be very, very prescriptive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, while legislatures &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pass a law about anything they generally only intervene when there is some &quot;mischief&quot; in society that the current laws are not addressing or are addressing in an unjust way. This happens all the time because society does not stand still: we didn't need laws about cell phone use in cars until there were cell phones being implicated in accidents.

For the force to be justified, you have to reasonably believe you are in danger of being harmed, that you need to use force to avoid the harm, and you may only use the minimum force necessary to eliminate the threat. It then is a matter for the jury to decide whether those principles were followed in your particular instance. The reason why it's hard to predict the outcome is that it depends on a subjective evaluation by the jury, as to whether the shooter had a reasonable fear and whether lesser force was a viable option. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The jury's decision is guided by instructions to the jury (#506, #506) which focus on relevant distinctions. The jury will be told that &quot;Belief in future harm is not sufficient, no matter how great or how likely the harm is believed to be&quot;, and that you have to reasonably believe there is &quot;imminent danger of great bodily injury&quot;.

But in the present instance, the &lt;em&gt;bank&lt;/em&gt; is being robbed and the shooter is a by-stander. Despite all of the bank robberies in California, there is no relevant case from which one could draw an analogy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4501" LastActivityDate="2016-08-21T05:44:19.970" CommentCount="4" />

In other words, as co-owner of the IP, the right to exploit the technology for itself always existed with the Company &amp;amp; is not what is being offered (for sale) here via Clause-y. What is being offered by University to Company (for payment) is for the University to forfeit its licensing rights as a co-owner OR&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even for self-exploitation of the IP the company will need to sign a &quot;separate agreement&quot; with the University (and presumably pay it money / royalty)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's the right interpretation of this?

I have been at this one way or another for 30 years. I will answer based upon my experience and the perspective of the law(s) where I have operated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I read your question, it appears that you vacated before the termination of your 1 year lease agreement. Assuming I read things correctly, the original lease is still in effect and that the lease has not converted to a month to month lease as this requires the original lease to expire. If this is the case, then you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; give a 60 day notice as required within the lease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your 1 year lease has actually expired, then you are on a month by month lease which requires notice according to the terms of the lease. If no specific terms of a month to month lease do not exist, then state law applies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please be careful about how you read your lease.&lt;/em&gt; I am taking your description of your lease as being gospel, whereas, your reflection of the lease may not be accurate. For example, it may be presumed that even as your lease converts to a month to month lease, a 60 day notice still applies. Without reading your lease, one cannot be sure and we must take your word for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that any lease generally ends at midnight on any given date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tenant / Landlord law allows for modification by agreement of some terms of the law such as notice. While I am not in Wisconsin, I assume this is true in all states. This means that if an agreement is in place regarding notice, then state law does not apply in this area. It is not uncommon that landlords modify the terms of the law by simply placing them within the lease. This can also include the removal of some rights granted by the law where the law allows for it. So be careful to read the entire law and not cherry pick what seems apply immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, any landlord is required to make reasonable efforts to mitigate all loses. This generally means advertising, showing, interviewing, and accepting and processing applications. If the landlord is unaware of your intentions, he is not able to do this effectively. Why? Because by law you have rights to the property and the landlord is not able to preempt an action he may perceive to be the case. In otherwords, I suspect you are moving, however, I am still not able to show the property, take applications on the property, or enter into an agreement with another for the property.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case, you vacated the property. Even with that, some landlords are restricted by law for a term to regain rights to any property that has been vacated or even abandoned. Some states require a period of time and a process by which portions of the eviction process must be sought in order to regain access to the property. This can be significant both in terms of time and financial cost for which you are fully liable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By not giving notice, and that includes notification of your vacating the property, the landlord may have no legal choice but to follow the law and let the property remain empty for a period as the process proceeds. In some states, this can be months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most landlords are very reasonable and will wave the 60 day requirement if you have been a good tenant and you are working to help the landlord rent the property. This can include allowing the landlord to show the property and giving reasonable and realistic expectations of your departure. Since you have not done this, it is very reasonable and highly likely that the landlord will consider your violation of the lease as a breaking of a contract and seek all damages allowed under the law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The long and the short of it all is that a landlord wants his rent and likely does not care if there is minimal or little downtime in this effort. However, by making a break in the landlords ability to earn money on his property will make him/her mad. Why? Because landlords, even for one property have significant financial liabilities for which they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; recover damages. Landlords take on HUGE responsibilities for which there seems to be little respect for. Given that so many tenants treat rentals more like hotels and place the full responsibility and liabilities on the landlord their action, breaking leases without notice is one sure fire way to make sure that the lease is fully enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while you may not trust your landlord, your only recourse is when the process has fully played out, and you feel that the landlord has not mitigated damages as prescribed by law including the laws by which he must adhere to, then you can file a civil suit. Until then, you no longer have a recourse except to defend any action the landlord brings before the court. In otherowrds, the person you hurt is/was yourself. In most states, the landlord always wins short of a violation of the law you can point to that the landlord has committed. Even then, the landlord still often wins something for which you are liable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5306" LastEditorUserId="5306" LastEditDate="2016-08-21T18:21:06.467" LastActivityDate="2016-08-21T18:21:06.467" CommentCount="28" />

One is that the the lease contains no automatic renewal clause. If that is the case, you have no obligation beyond the end of the lease, which would presumably be up soon. You do owe rent until the end of the lease. The letter does not bind you to anything, though it is an offer on the part of the landlord which you can accept or not. In general, one party cannot bind another to an extension of a contract, unless doing so is in accord with the terms of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an automatical renewal clause in the lease then under &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/704#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wisconsin law&lt;/a&gt;, such a clause&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;is not enforceable against the tenant unless the lessor, at least 15&#xA;  days but not more than 30 days prior to the time specified for the&#xA;  giving of such notice to the lessor, gives to the tenant written&#xA;  notice in the same manner as specified in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/704.21&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;s. 704.21&lt;/a&gt; calling the&#xA;  attention of the tenant to the existence of the provision in the lease&#xA;  for automatic renewal or extension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing in your description suggests that this has been done, so unless you left out something important, either there is no auto-renew clause, or it is unenforceable given the lapse in notification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lease cannot require you to physically remain with your possessions in the residence, it simply states how long you have a duty to pay rent and have the right to occupy the premise. So it is immaterial if you move out before the end of the lease, as long as you pay rent due. A 60 day notice clause for termination refers to terminating a lease before the date specified in the lease -- there is no requirement to notify a landlord that you are not renewing a lease.

Assuming that no obstruction permit was obtained, what usually happens is that an officer is sent to tell the owner to remove the obstruction (more or less immediately), and if nobody is at the site whom they can tell, they probably won't go any further (e.g. asking neighbors where the owner is).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no legal definition of &quot;reasonable time&quot;, instead the law simply takes that to mean &quot;the amount of time a reasonable person would require&quot;.

That is, if the contract purports to require anything that is unlawful in the jurisdiction then (barring a severance clause) it is not a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In common law countries, the starting point is that people are free to contract for and about anything they like - a contract is simply a mechanism for exchanging value between the parties on whatever terms they wish. However, judges and legislatures have decided that there are some things you cannot trade and some terms that are unconscionable or against the public interest and these vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction*.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a contract is not legal in any jurisdiction if its terms seek to exclude the intervention of the courts - this is against public policy. So for example, a binding arbitration clause requiring the parties to accept a private arbitrator's decision as final excludes the courts, yes? Well, in Australia, yes, such clauses if used in a contract between parties with different bargaining power (like a Telco and its customers) are invalid because they prevent the weaker party pursuing a class action. However, they are perfectly legal in the United States because the SCOTUS has determined that the customer can persue litigation &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; arbitration is finished so this doesn't impede the courts. These are essentially the same laws interpreted by the courts so that they have totally opposite effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this might lead you to think that you'll put one in - it'll be OK in the US and Australians will represent such a tiny share of your market that you don't care if I can't enforce my ToS there.

According to NC general statute &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutelookup.pl?statute=14-415.11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;§ 14-415.11&lt;/a&gt;, among other places, you cannot carry your concealed handgun &quot;On any private premises where notice that carrying a concealed handgun is prohibited by the posting of a conspicuous notice or statement by the person in legal possession or control of the premises.&quot; Ordinarily I would avoid a business or location such as this, but I found another statute that is specifically in regards to parks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;§ 14-415.23.  Statewide uniformity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(a)        It is the intent of the General Assembly to prescribe a uniform system for the regulation of legally carrying a concealed handgun. To insure uniformity, no political subdivisions, boards, or agencies of the State nor any county, city, municipality, municipal corporation, town, township, village, nor any department or agency thereof, may enact ordinances, rules, or regulations concerning legally carrying a concealed handgun. A unit of local government may adopt an ordinance to permit the posting of a prohibition against carrying a concealed handgun, in accordance with G.S. 14-415.11(c), on local government buildings and their appurtenant premises.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(b)        A unit of local government may adopt an ordinance to prohibit, by posting, the carrying of a concealed handgun on municipal and county recreational facilities that are specifically identified by the unit of local government. If a unit of local government adopts such an ordinance with regard to recreational facilities, then the concealed handgun permittee may, nevertheless, secure the handgun in a locked vehicle within the trunk, glove box, or other enclosed compartment or area within or on the motor vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(c)        For purposes of this section, the term &quot;recreational facilities&quot; includes &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(d)       For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;recreational facilities&quot; &lt;strong&gt;does not include any greenway,&lt;/strong&gt; designated biking or walking path, an area that is customarily used as a walkway or bike path although not specifically designated for such use, open areas or fields where athletic events may occur unless the area qualifies as an &quot;athletic field&quot; pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, and any other area that is not specifically described in subsection (c) of this section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_14/gs_14-415.23.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_14/gs_14-415.23.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, if I am interpreting this correctly, since Raleigh is a city or political subdivision in the state of NC, and the Greenway is NOT a permitted &quot;Recreational Facility&quot;, the City Council CANNOT have, post, or enforce this ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to sum up my question, is my interpretation correct?

A few months later, things went wrong with his family life and he stopped speaking to me. I furiously tended to end up the relationship by directly stating my intention to him. The person didn't like it, and so he engaged in sort of threats; he said he will call my relatives and tell them inappropriate things about me, that he will destroy my reputation in the very small community we used to live in. I lost these messages (proofs) as they are very old. I realized that this person is manipulating me, either using emotions or using power. &#xA;Unfortunately, I was immature enough to accept his apologies months later. He had surely no valid reason for putting us in such a bad situation in the first place, but we went back together, with him preserving the same possessive attitude. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a similar episode of this took place, and I broke up with him, by ending every communication with him. I stopped answering his calls and messages, but I didn't change my phone number or email/facebook account. The person is still stalking me to this very day. He keeps calling, he sends text messages, he stalks me on LINE, Whatsapp, Google Hangouts, LinkedIN.. He does not say bad things, he asks me to talk to him, to restore the relationship, to meet him.. &#xA;He dared to contact the next person I got into a relationship with, I am not sure about how far it went between them, but my boyfriend seemed very concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I, clearly, expressed my position regarding this relationship, I said there could be no chance for us going back together, but he didn't seem to swallow it. I even said I got engaged with another person, I said my family forced me to cut the ties with him, but nothing worked.&#xA;I know the person is kind of psychopath, one who is still stalking me for 5 years does not seem healthy to me. Now I live alone in my flat, in a city far from my family. A few months ago, I got a text from him where he says that he saw me on a specific day in a specific place around my new house, and it was true. I feel insecure and even threatened. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there seems no law in my developing country that might protect me from such a stalker, especially with the absence of a direct and clear physical threat..I dont think that the police might take the &quot;evidence&quot; I have about being stalked and harassed any seriously.&#xA;I am still investigating in my country law, I thought about referring to a lawyer.

To that question, I think the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Missouri Courts have defined the test for “abandoned property” in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1736326/herron-v-whiteside/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herron v. Whiteside&lt;/em&gt;, 782 S.W.2d 414, 416 (Mo. App. W. Dist. 1989)&lt;/a&gt;, stating: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Abandonment is the voluntary relinquishment of ownership so that the&#xA;  property ceases to be the property of any person and becomes the&#xA;  subject of appropriation by the first taker. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2440830/wirth-v-heavey/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wirth v. Heavey&lt;/em&gt;, 508&#xA;  S.W.2d 263, 267 (Mo.App.1974)&lt;/a&gt;. Abandonment of property requires intent&#xA;  plus an act. &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;. A sufficient act is one that manifests a conscious&#xA;  purpose and intention of the owner of personal property neither to use&#xA;  nor to retake the property into his possession. &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;. Intention to&#xA;  abandon may be inferred from strong and convincing evidence and may be&#xA;  shown by conduct clearly inconsistent with any intention to retain and&#xA;  continue the use or ownership of the property.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herron&lt;/em&gt;, 782 S.W.2d at 416.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to synthesize that passage from &lt;em&gt;Herron&lt;/em&gt;, the court is saying that there is a 2 part test for determining if property is abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did the person intend to abandon the property?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did they commit some act to show this intention?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is yes, to both, they the “first taker” or person that gets possession after the property is abandoned is the new owner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, it seems that the 19 year-old intended to abandon the property. He left without explaining why and stated that he would not unload the property if the nice family tried to return it (implying he would not accept the property back).

Rather, the current basis exists in the Data Protection Directive, 95/46/EC, article 12(b):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right of access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Member States shall guarantee every data subject the right to obtain&#xA;  from the controller:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(b) as appropriate the rectification, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;erasure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or blocking of data the&#xA;  processing of which does not comply with the provisions of this&#xA;  Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate&#xA;  nature of the data;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was one of the main points upon which the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decided &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=152065&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=en&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=982675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google Spain v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD) and Mario Costeja González&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the judgement which allowed for individuals to ask for search engines to remove results containing personal data. The CJEU explained that the 'right to be forgotten' was not absolute and should take into account economic considerations as well as other rights (paragraphs 85 - 88).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDPR, article 17, for purposes of contrast, has a more robust and explicit right of erasure than currently in force:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 17&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase&#xA;  personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds&#xA;  applies:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;Shortened for clarity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GDPR, article 17 fleshes out much of the lack of specifics that the Directive's article 12(b). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 is a transposition of the Data Protection Directive. This means that the full effect of the rights and obligations in the Directive are contained within the Data Protection Act 1998. Furthermore, the interpretation of the rights and obligations of the Data Protection Directive by the CJEU are highly influential on interpretation of the Data Protection Act 1998. This is due to the European Communities Act 1972, s 3(2) which states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Judicial notice shall be taken of the Treaties, of the Official&#xA;  Journal of the Communities and of any decision of, or expression of&#xA;  opinion by, the European Court on any such question as aforesaid; and&#xA;  the Official Journal shall be admissible as evidence of any instrument&#xA;  or other act thereby communicated of any of the Communities or of any&#xA;  Community institution&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even without the above provision, it would be extremely likely that British courts would take into account &lt;em&gt;Google Spain&lt;/em&gt;, given that the foundation of the Data Protection Act 1998 is the Data Protection Directive. The most likely outcome is for British courts to uphold the interpretation in &lt;em&gt;Google Spain&lt;/em&gt; and allow for data subjects to request removal from search engines. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is not entirely possible to know without a test case, but it is doubtful any major search engine would attempt to deviate from the current situation as there is currently legal certainty. The Data Protection Act 1998 will still be in force after the future Brexit agreement and is certainly not contingent on continued EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8931" LastActivityDate="2016-08-27T11:08:55.307" CommentCount="0" />

The concept of functional immunity relies on mutual respect of sovereigns and applies to government officials acting in their official capacities. From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Functional immunity arises from customary international law and treaty law and confers immunities on those performing acts of state (usually a foreign official). Any person who in performing an act of state commits a criminal offence is immune from prosecution. This is so even after the person ceases to perform acts of state. Thus it is a type of immunity limited in the acts to which it attaches (acts of state) but will only end if the state itself ceases to exist. This immunity, though applied to the acts of individuals, is an attribute of a state, and is based on the mutual respect of states for sovereign equality and state dignity. States thus have a significant interest in upholding the principle in international affairs: if a state's officials are to be tried at all for anything, it will be at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;State offices usually recognised as automatically attracting this immunity are the head of state or head of government, senior cabinet members, ambassadors and the foreign and defence ministers. Many countries have embodied these immunities in domestic law. States regularly assert that every official acting in their official capacity is immune from prosecution by foreign authorities (for non-international crimes) under the doctrine of ratione materiae. Such officers are immune from prosecution for everything they do during their time in office. For example, an English court held that a warrant could not be issued for the arrest of Robert Mugabe on charges of international crimes on the basis that he was a presently serving Head of State at the time the proceedings were brought. Other examples are the attempts to prosecute Fidel Castro in Spain and Jiang Zemin in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might argue that this doesn't apply to low-level officials like those administering capital punishment but I don't know if that is convincing. Clearly, the US believes they are acting in their official capacities or the US would arrest them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To arrest an executioner from the US for the crime of carrying out his or her official duty would be to deny the sovereignty of the United States and might be dealt with harshly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2690" LastActivityDate="2016-08-29T14:37:42.540" CommentCount="3" />

It's not a crime with international implications, and it's not a crime which is so fundamentally horrific that it needs to be ended by any means necessary. The death penalty has never been considered to be that fundamentally horrific, and likely never will be, particularly when (as in the US) it is limited to people who have committed something that is an extremely serious crime in any country (i.e. murder). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only way France could make a remotely plausible argument that it gets to punish American executioners is if they're dual citizens or if they executed a French citizen.

The Act also defines what counts as &quot;hour worked&quot; for these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs79d.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fact Sheet # 79D&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Department of Labor gives more details about what counts as &quot;hours worked&quot; for domestic services under the FLSA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The general rule is that all time during the shift counts, whether the employee is busy or not:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Generally, when an employee is “on duty” (that is they must be in the&#xA;  home and prepared to provide services when  required), they are&#xA;  working.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only exception is that &lt;strong&gt;time spent sleeping may be deducted under certain circumstances&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In some circumstances, an employer may exclude up to eight hours an&#xA;  employee spends sleeping at the worksite from  the time for which an&#xA;  employee must be paid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rules are different, depending on whether the employee permanently resides at the place of work (&quot;Live-in employee), has shifts of &gt;=24 hours or shifts of &amp;lt;24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case the shift is &gt;=24 hours, so the rule is (see page three of the document): &lt;strong&gt;Up to eight hours of sleep time may be excluded from hours worked&lt;/strong&gt;, provided that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sleeping facilities are available&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the employee can usually sleep at least five hours without disturbance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the employee agrees to exclude sleep time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even then, interruptions of sleep for work must be paid, and if the employee get &amp;lt;5 hours sleep during a given shift, no exclusion is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in summary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For calculating hourly wage and overtime pay, the employer must count at least 16 hours for each 24 hour shift, and more if the employee cannot sleep for eight hours during the shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It probably does not matter that the employer calls it &quot;12 hours worked&quot;, but your mother is entitled to at least &quot;minium wage x 16&quot; for each shift worked, and is entitled to overtime pay (at least 1.5 times minimum wage) if she works more than two shifts per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the shift is ever reduced to less than 24 hours, even sleep time may not be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1185" LastEditorUserId="1185" LastEditDate="2016-08-31T15:53:08.173" LastActivityDate="2016-08-31T15:53:08.173" CommentCount="1" />

In this conversation, Allen presents himself as a reasonable person and repeatedly asserts Acme’s trustworthiness, how much they keep their word, and how they will do so here, despite Bob’s past experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allen then sends Bob an extremely broad release form to sign. The release form cites amount $X but makes no mention of Y or Z, and buried in there is language that the undersigned (as marked under the line, Bob) acknowledges having &lt;em&gt;already received&lt;/em&gt; $X and gives up any rights to ever pursue any related amounts in the future.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Bob signs, Bob loses all rights to the claim and Acme does not even have to pay $X, because it can point to Bob’s signature acknowledging that he had already been paid in full.  Given the complexity of the document, it is unlikely that unsophisticated, &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt; Bob will notice this.  Even if he notices the words, it is likely that Bob would sign anyway based on Allen’s previous verbal assurances that $X, Y, and Z would happen, combined with Allen’s efforts to appear reasonable and convince Bob to trust Acme.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Bob does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sign, Acme similarly does not make payment because Allen had previously established the signature as a precondition to payment (“Acme policy.”).  Bob retains the right to pursue the claim and even if he later wins a similar judgment against Acme, Acme gains the full benefit of the delay, at Bob’s cost.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allen’s deception strategy seems most likely to have a big payoff if it is successful in fooling Bob, and a small payoff if it is not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any way this strategy could, in practice, significantly backfire?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If Bob were &quot;playing&quot; optimally, what, if anything, could he &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt; he do to make it backfire?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If nothing, why is it not commonly taught in law schools as an effective way to win over an adversary and best protect a client’s interests? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuation: If Bob signed, and gets annoyed at Acme's failure to follow through on $X, Y, and/or Z, Acme's strategy is to present the signed release (perhaps calling special attention to the acknowledgement of payment received) to the Court, blocking Bob from pursuing that line of inquiry any further.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the unlikely event that Bob manages to overcome that block and figure out + execute all the legal steps needed to reach an evidentiary hearing about whether or not payment was made, Acme's strategy is to cause the finder of fact to believe that Bob had stated a preference for cash payment and Acme conceded to Bob's wishes, underscored by the clear evidence that Bob signed acknowledging receipt of the funds.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assume that Allen presents himself to the Court as a reasonable person, that Acme is at least a locally powerful institution that many assume to be credible, and that Allen's role as an attorney further strengthens of the assumption of credibility that others in the courtroom apply to Allen in representing Acme, &lt;a href=&quot;http://law.stackexchange.com/a/4931/4800&quot;&gt;particularly in contrast to non-attorney Bob&lt;/a&gt;.  As a result, any claim Bob makes about Acme contrary to a statement Bob himself signed is likely to reduce his own credibility more than Acme's; Bob and Allen both know this.

That means that you cannot try to &quot;trick&quot; someone with the terms of the contract and expect to enforce that contract against them and you cannot try to skirt your obligations by finding a tricky form of compliance not within the mutual understanding of the agreement.

YouTube exposes an API explicitly so that you can embed videos into new contexts, even if the videos are not your own. The copyright holder for the video (assuming the video was legally uploaded by the copyright holder or an authorized agent) agreed to the YouTube terms of use, which allows embedding. If the copyright holder didn't want to allow embedding, they can easily opt out of this functionality. Obviously, if you circumvent YouTube's API to embed a video whose owner explicitly opted out of embedding, then you're in violation of YouTube's terms of use. If you embed a video whose owner did not opt out of embedding, the owner agreed, at upload time, to YouTube's request for permission for the video to be embeddable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note also that YouTube has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specific requirements for use of their embedded viewer and API&lt;/a&gt;. You can't just use it any way you want.

BUT, @Dale's answer is fundamentally incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Article V:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several observations that should be noted here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A constitutional amendment is &quot;...valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution&quot;.  In other words, it becomes &lt;em&gt;a part&lt;/em&gt; of the constitution itself.  The Supreme Court cannot rule unconstitutional something that is &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; the constitution. Indeed, if such an amendment were to pass, the only thing that could modify or repeal it is &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; constitutional amendment -- which cannot happen because a further amendment would then be unconstitutional on its face.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The executive and judicial branches of the government are conspicuously absent from the amendment process.  Ratification of amendments is exclusively a legislative action -- that means two thirds of both houses of Congress and 3/4ths of the state legislatures.  The only power of judicial review the Supreme Court could have would be procedural in nature (i.e. was the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; in Article V followed correctly?), and the President would not be able to veto it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The only subject that is off-limits in the amendment process is equal suffrage in the Senate.

Strictly from a constitutional perspective, the people it serves are free to completely destroy it or undermine it as much as they want, as long as the proper procedure for doing so is followed.
